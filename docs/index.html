And in the reading section he writes short summaries on the books he's read.<br /><br />For people who don't know him that well or at all, there are also links to his talks and other nonsense but I usually check only the main "thread" and the reading list. I was even mentioned in one of the reading list's entries (not as an author though!).<br /></div><hr /></div><div><h3>24 Dec, 2020</h3><div>Every now and then there will be a CEO running his or her mouth about... the evolution of a workplace. Usually it means they are trying to see you a co-working space, an open office design (I wish people who invented this particular setup have a very long vacation in hell), a food-catering service or an app or two. Whatever it is a CEO (or a co-founder, investor, investor's boyfriend's grandmother) will come to a conclusion that the latest-greatest-coolest-toppest workplace is a so-called flexible work-space. Confused? Let me translate. It means you don't have a workplace but you still have to come to an office that's usually located not close to where you live.<br /><br />As my friend Oli says: "let's take a step back".<br /><br />So, flexible work-space. You come to this CEO's office and commence a game of music chairs. Remember those? Kids? People, who were in kindergarten and primary school before COVID-19? You run around the room while the music is playing (other kids do the same and all of them are your enemies, you have no friends or allies in this game, it's as brutal as life itself). When the music stops you must plant your ass on a chair. The catch? If the number of kids is N you get N-1 chairs.<br /><br />But this would be an easy level of flexible workplace (work-space? I'm as confused as you are). The easy level is for wimps, the people who can do their work with a tiny macbook air, opening it every once in a while to answer 20 emails, generate 50 more emails, post, like, subscribe, unsubscribe and quickly check on that bitcoin price. This is the level for top management, their friends, their grandmas' boyfriends.<br /><br />Let's take another step back.<br /><br />In comes an engineer. And IT guy. A developer, a devops, a computer geek. A lonely ninja wielding his IDEs and Emacses and key-chords and Stackoverflows and coffee mugs and Metallica t-shirts. She has a laptop, three big monitors, a mechanical keyboard a mouse, an usb-hub and maybe an air humidifier (oh and a lava lamp! one cannot produce quality software or tame a Cthulhu-level IT system without a lava lamp! it's against everything that the bible stands for!). And now she needs to run around the office space with a whole cart loaded with hardware and wires (it's 2020, where's my wireless electricity, you fools?!). And she needs to look for an empty desk. And maybe there is one and maybe there isn't. And maybe the available one is on the top floor or in the basement. Maybe it's by a window and maybe it has a nice open view facing the two doors of the office toilet. When she finds (if she finds!) an empty desk, she needs to set everything up. By the time she's done, it's lunch time. Oh, and don't forget to break everything down and clean the desk in the evening after you done. This is a flexible environment. This desk doesn't belong to you. You should brace yourself for tomorrow's desk hunt.<br /><br />This is the level that most people will have to deal with. The people that do the actual work. You know, build those apps, keep those services up, quality check those API layers and databases and keep the patches up-to-date and read "the angry orange website" 10 times a day. These people cannot do their work with a macbook air. They need their work-space once and for all.<br /><br />So please, when you hear this flexible open space disruption, just walk away. Let them enjoy their own bullshit as much as they want to. We have stuff to do, lives to live, travel the informational highway. Forever. Into the 8-bit sunset.<br /></div><hr /></div><div><h3>22 Dec, 2020</h3><div>I was reading some books by Norwegian authors for the last couple of months.<br /><br />First one was "Growth of the Soil" by Knut Hamsun. I didn't know what to expect.<br />I knew from the comments that it was a classic, the comments were mixed though,<br />someone said it was too slow (which usually means a good thing from my<br />perspective).<br /><br />I liked the book a lot. Probably because I could relate a little bit with the<br />main guy, but also because the people stories spread across the book were<br />interesting and... real. Reminded me about Steinbeck a little bit, but... no one<br />can touch Steinbeck in terms of small people stories. No one!<br /><br />So I wanted to read more Norwegian books. And I've realized (not without the<br />help of my wife) that I have never read "A Doll's House", which is a play by<br />Henrik Ibsen. It was a short fast read. Light and fun and to the point.<br /><br />Those Norwegians can write! I thought. So I grabbed another book. "The Birds"<br />Tarjei Vesaas. Honestly I don't know how to pronounce that name, but the book is<br />special. It's like a virtual reality simulation. It allows you to spend time as<br />this young man with a mental illness. With zero cliches.<br /><br />Now I wanted to only read Norwegian authors till the day I die, which I hoped<br />will not come soon. I thought I will try something modern. Really modern. And<br />fun. Meaning, not a classic, not on a serious topic, not a demanding read. I've<br />learned about Jo Nesbo, the modern Norwegian author of detective thriller novels<br />(krimis for ze Germans). He has this cycle of novels about Harry Hole<br />(pronounced more like "holly" and has nothing to do with Cobain's wife's band).<br />Anyway, I've grabbed the first book in the series. And I hated it. Ok-ok, not<br />really hated it, but it wasn't fun to read. I was expecting a page turner, fun<br />adventures, with the required Scandinavian twists: rape, bodily mutilations,<br />cutting people in pieces... I'm not joking, when the book reader was showing 50%<br />that's where they find this one guy detached from all of his extremities. All of<br />them.<br /><br />But the book was boring. Bursting with cliches and sayings that you learn about<br />from soviet English textbooks but then never hear anyone using those in real<br />life.<br /><br />Anyway... Not trying to bash on Nesbo, I'm sure he has better books, but I will<br />not try any for a long time. Thankfully there are more classics and modern<br />books. And hopefully one day I will learn norsk sufficiently to be able to read<br />some original works.<br /></div><hr /></div><div><h3>21 Dec, 2020</h3><div>So, first things first. This is not a blog. A blog is a complicated beast with<br />tags and categories, titles and neatly positioned images. I cannot be bothered<br />with this sort of thing right now.<br /><br />And this is why this... thing, this series of monologues about nothing and about<br />everything, look the way it look. It's just a folder full of text files shown in<br />a chronologically descending order. No formatting, except some minimal HTML, no<br />thinking about how it looks. Just text. On... screen.<br /><br />Secondly, I wanted something to track my thoughts mostly for the future me. I<br />didn't want to read comments, engage with readers, follow statistics to see,<br />which combination of words attracted more viewers. I just want to post and have<br />it accessible. I will share this link with a couple of people, the people, to<br />whom I right every now and then anyway. And the link will always be available to<br />me. So I can read back about my days if I forget or need a reminder about the<br />past life. Maybe it will happen when I'm old and tired and just want a glimpse<br />at the glorious past. Maybe it will happen earlier.<br /><br />I should stop writing and save the file. Funny thing... this will not be<br />published for sure until I finish the site generating code. So for now this is<br />just a text file on my laptop that shall become a beautiful butterfly some day<br />soon.<br /></div><hr /></div></div>            <a href="archive.html">Archive</a>        </code>    </body></html>
