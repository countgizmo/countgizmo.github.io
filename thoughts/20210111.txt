I've stumbled upon a practical way of using average numbers in real life.

Yeah, I know what an average is, but to be honest I have never seen a lot of
sense of using it in real life. Unless you are splitting the bill into equal
parts or something. But that happens less frequently these days.

But, reading this book about information theory today, I've noticed a fun way to
use average numbers.

Let's try some examples.

Example one:

I live in a country where average salary is 5$. I know that my salary is 7$.
This automatically means that there must be at least one person that has a
salary that is less than 5$. Probably around 3$. And the higher my salary is in
comparison to the known average (that is probably reported in the news every
year either to brag or to shock the readers even if the readers are the same
people that write the news) the lower the salary of someone else in the same
country.

[It's probably obvious to some math-brained people, but it wasn't to me, so shut
up!]

Example two:

If an average life span of a human is 59 years (a number that I've just
invented) and you go to a cemetery and find a grave stone of a child that was
alive for only 5 days... there must be a person in the world who is waaaaay
older than 59 years (I'm too lazy to calculate but you get the idea).

What do it all mean to me?

I'm not trying to be philosophical about it (although I can). I'm just seeing
this cool way of getting a quick sure information about the world by knowing
just two numbers, when one of those numbers is an average and the other one is a
sample from that average. Makes me appreciate math (which I usually don't do
often). And makes me a bit scared when I think up more and more example based on
my personal data and the average numbers.
