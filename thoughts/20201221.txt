So, first things first. This is not a blog. A blog is a complicated beast with
tags and categories, titles and neatly positioned images. I cannot be bothered
with this sort of thing right now.

And this is why this... thing, this series of monologues about nothing and about
everything, look the way it look. It's just a folder full of text files shown in
a chronologically descending order. No formatting, except some minimal HTML, no
thinking about how it looks. Just text. On... screen.

Secondly, I wanted something to track my thoughts mostly for the future me. I
didn't want to read comments, engage with readers, follow statistics to see,
which combination of words attracted more viewers. I just want to post and have
it accessible. I will share this link with a couple of people, the people, to
whom I right every now and then anyway. And the link will always be available to
me. So I can read back about my days if I forget or need a reminder about the
past life. Maybe it will happen when I'm old and tired and just want a glimpse
at the glorious past. Maybe it will happen earlier.

I should stop writing and save the file. Funny thing... this will not be
published for sure until I finish the site generating code. So for now this is
just a text file on my laptop that shall become a beautiful butterfly some day
soon.
