I didn't know what to expect.<br />I knew from the comments that it was a classic, the comments were mixed though,<br />someone said it was too slow (which usually means a good thing from my<br />perspective).<br /><br />I liked the book a lot. Probably because I could relate a little bit with the<br />main guy, but also because the people stories spread across the book were<br />interesting and... real. Reminded me about Steinbeck a little bit, but... no one<br />can touch Steinbeck in terms of small people stories. No one!<br /><br />So I wanted to read more Norwegian books. And I've realized (not without the<br />help of my wife) that I have never read "A Doll's House", which is a play by<br />Henrik Ibsen. It was a short fast read. Light and fun and to the point.<br /><br />Those Norwegians can write! I thought. So I grabbed another book. "The Birds"<br />Tarjei Vesaas. Honestly I don't know how to pronounce that name, but the book is<br />special. It's like a virtual reality simulation. It allows you to spend time as<br />this young man with a mental illness. With zero cliches.<br /><br />Now I wanted to only read Norwegian authors till the day I die, which I hoped<br />will not come soon. I thought I will try something modern. Really modern. And<br />fun. Meaning, not a classic, not on a serious topic, not a demanding read. I've<br />learned about Jo Nesbo, the modern Norwegian author of detective thriller novels<br />(krimis for ze Germans). He has this cycle of novels about Harry Hole<br />(pronounced more like "holly" and has nothing to do with Cobain's wife's band).<br />Anyway, I've grabbed the first book in the series. And I hated it. Ok-ok, not<br />really hated it, but it wasn't fun to read. I was expecting a page turner, fun<br />adventures, with the required Scandinavian twists: rape, bodily mutilations,<br />cutting people in pieces... I'm not joking, when the book reader was showing 50%<br />that's where they find this one guy detached from all of his extremities. All of<br />them.<br /><br />But the book was boring. Bursting with cliches and sayings that you learn about<br />from soviet English textbooks but then never hear anyone using those in real<br />life.<br /><br />Anyway... Not trying to bash on Nesbo, I'm sure he has better books, but I will<br />not try any for a long time. Thankfully there are more classics and modern<br />books. And hopefully one day I will learn norsk sufficiently to be able to read<br />some original works.<br /></div><hr /></div><div><h3>21 Dec, 2020</h3><div>So, first things first. This is not a blog. A blog is a complicated beast with<br />tags and categories, titles and neatly positioned images. I cannot be bothered<br />with this sort of thing right now.<br /><br />And this is why this... thing, this series of monologues about nothing and about<br />everything, look the way it look. It's just a folder full of text files shown in<br />a chronologically descending order. No formatting, except some minimal HTML, no<br />thinking about how it looks. Just text. On... screen.<br /><br />Secondly, I wanted something to track my thoughts mostly for the future me. I<br />didn't want to read comments, engage with readers, follow statistics to see,<br />which combination of words attracted more viewers. I just want to post and have<br />it accessible. I will share this link with a couple of people, the people, to<br />whom I right every now and then anyway. And the link will always be available to<br />me. So I can read back about my days if I forget or need a reminder about the<br />past life. Maybe it will happen when I'm old and tired and just want a glimpse<br />at the glorious past. Maybe it will happen earlier.<br /><br />I should stop writing and save the file. Funny thing... this will not be<br />published for sure until I finish the site generating code. So for now this is<br />just a text file on my laptop that shall become a beautiful butterfly some day<br />soon.<br /></div><hr /></div></div>            <a href="archive.html">Archive</a>        </code>    </body></html>
