It was 1995. It was 5 years before the end of the world. It was summer.
Crazy appleseeds were hanging from a great chestnut tree standing between two small windows. The windows smelled of onion. The appleseeds smiled lots and lots. They were crazy every summer. Till the world changed.
It was 1996. Summer got hotter. Trees were no fun anymore. Pixels were fun. Strategizing was fun. Mashing buttons was fun. Appleseeds were pleased with life of simplicity. They needed a TV, some cookies, a lot of water and a pinch of electricity. No Internet was required. No subscriptions services or avocado toasts. No motivational speaker. It was them, non-blinking, smiling, in awe every 50 minutes or so. Information traveled from balcony to ear to legs to balcony. Fast, cheap, low-tech, low-bandwidth. Pixels told good stories. Appleseeds were happy. School was a couple of months away. The end of the world was 4 years away.
It was 1997. While the world moved and shacked and got connected and re-connected and learned how to punch itself and make soap and rap... The appleseeds learned some new words, looked at images on paper and were riding the pixels every-freaking-day-no-school-no-parents-no-girlfriends-no-boyfriends-no-diets-no-taxes-no-deadlines-no-career-ladders-no-children-with-diapers... nothing could stop them. And nothing did.
2000 came. Yeah, I've skipped a few summers. They were mostly good. No such thing as a bad summer, right? 2000 came and stopped them. Yeah. Without lifting a finger, without crashing the Wall Street, without flooding the world with fire and water and self-navigating-exploding-squirrels-that-are-also-ninjas. It just came and went. And took the crazy appleseeds with it. Leaving a lot of tobacco smell, a puddle of saliva mixed with tears one-to-one and some really bad poetry.
It's 2021 today. I am not going back. I just can't.
