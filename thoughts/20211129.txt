And here we are friends, in 2D. Everything is in 2D. Even the cashiers in the supermarkets are behind a wall of clear plastic, imitating a screen. Don't worry. It's just like a Zoom window. Don't forget to unmute yourself.

Flat faces, muted claps, thumbs up, raised hands.

The EPOCH keeps increasing with the same speed while we are balancing between our virtual life and our virtual work, while we're paying with pixelated numbers for pixelated art, while we're learning how to hustle, how to live purposefully, how to eat mindfully and exercise correctly... from nineteen-year-olds.

Where's your mask? Where's your QR code? Where's you ID?

Wash your hands, wash your clothes, don't touch, stay away, stay safe, stay home, stay 2D on someone's screen. Don't forget to unmute yourself.
