I did find my camera a couple of days ago and took it with me for a<br />wonderful cold and gray walk through a district of Berlin that is particularly<br />hipstery and vibrant (yes, the smell of weed is everywhere... and it's a good<br />smell).<br /><br />I will not bore you with the whole photo real but there's one photo that kind of<br />fits today (2021... need to remember... not to write 2020 for the next 12<br />months...).<br /><br /><img src="img/howto_leave_matrix.jpeg" /><br /><br />Also, I just needed an image to work on my monologue engine's image support.<br />(Yes, this glorious website is generated by software I wrote myself during this<br />winter holiday).<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>04 Jan, 2021</h3><div>Wow, fourth of January already. It was the New Year celebration just a second<br />ago. We were eating salads and a cake and drinking coffee and tea and proseco<br />and singing songs and talking bullshit. And then it was midnight in Berlin and I<br />was brushing my teeth while everyone else were trying to burn the town down<br />(again). And now it's the fourth of January already. And soon it will be the 21st.<br /><br />But meanwhile we are here (and we are there if we are reading this much later).<br /><br />So, the previous year was special in a lot of ways. One of them was me<br />discovering a new musical artist (and his band) during one random event of an<br />insomnia. Two things happened one summer night in 2020: 1. I couldn't sleep, so<br />I've opened YouTube and clicked on a random music video, which was a concert by<br />Billy Strings. 2. I've realized that insomnia can provide an unexpected gift, so<br />you should never think of insomnia as a bad thing.<br /><br />Yeah, I was listening to a lot of live Billy Strings shows afterwards,<br />discovering the bluegrass genre, playing more guitar myself and singing songs<br />about drugs, prison and... summertime.<br /><br />I didn't have insomnia as often last year as before. Even though I was secretly<br />looking forward to more surprises from YouTube's algorithm, sleep deprived brain<br />and open-mindedness. I guess all that diet, vitamin supplements (D3 and B-100 in<br />particular) and consistent meditation practice -- they all did something to me.<br />Tonight I have seen one of the weirdest dreams of my life and I wasn't even<br />super tired or high yesterday.<br /><br />Anyway, I guess the point of this post is: go listen to Billy Strings. And if<br />you cannot sleep for some reason, just get up and try to enjoy non-sleeping<br />(don't try to be productive, try to be happy). That's all the advice I have for<br />the future me today.<br /><br />Fourth of Jan already??? Really??? I'm gonna be old and dead soon.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>06 Jan, 2021</h3><div>Sometimes when I'm walking outside (in 3d and full color) and passing near a bus<br />stop I see someone rushing towards the bus that has been standing there for a<br />few moments already with opened doors. People have already finished loading into<br />the bus. I can feel the doors beginning to close, the driver not seeing that<br />there's a person outside in the cold unfriendly street doing the best she can to<br />make it, running (maybe for the first time in years) with bags dangling in her<br />arms hitting her knees and messing up with her rhythm. And then... sometimes,<br />not every time, that rushing someone makes it to the bus. In these moments I<br />forget about most of the things. In these moments a wave of satisfaction and<br />warmness rushes over me. I feel good about the person that's made it onto the<br />bus in the last moment. I feel good about the driver. I feel good about the<br />other passengers. I feel good about people standing outside, seeing the same<br />small... miracle.<br /><br />It works with trams as well. It doesn't work with trains or subways.<br /></div></div></div>        </code>    </body></html>
