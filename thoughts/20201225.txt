My friend Oli has a very-very-very nice personal website: https://www.eidel.io/
The highlights are the: the articles and the Reading.

The articles are a good source of no-bullshit information about... anything really. And in the reading section he writes short summaries on the books he's read.

For people who don't know him that well or at all, there are also links to his talks and other nonsense but I usually check only the main "thread" and the reading list. I was even mentioned in one of the reading list's entries (not as an author though!).
