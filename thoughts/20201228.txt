My wife says it's too difficult for people think good happy thoughts. I tend to
agree. It's quite easy to prove this to myself as well. Just try to sit down and
simply think happy thoughts. Difficult, right? Sometimes even impossible. You
sit there for 5-10-20 minutes trying to come up with one good thought and you
cannot. It's especially difficult if I say: memories are not allowed. Plus,
memories are sooo different for different people. Some of us have full lives of
happy moments, others... better stay away from that memory pool.

But I wonder. What if I make this a practice: 5 minutes a day make myself think
happy/good/positive thoughts. And leave the happy memories for extra occasions.
Meaning, I could try sitting there thinking about what's good happening in my
life right now, or in the world, or just daydreaming of something really nice.
And what if I do that every day. Will it make my brain more accustomed to think
good and not bad. Will it make me less critical of everything and more
understanding? Will I start to see more opportunities and less obstacles?

Let's try and see what happens.
