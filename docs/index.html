But that's the world we live in. We have valuable unicorns. And there's obviously a competition amongst them.<br /><br />In other news... AIs writing news articles after 2 seconds of the actual event happening. Journalists? Who are they?<br /><br />I was thinking about text yesterday. People came up with the idea of writing stuff down and then reading that stuff consistently. Then other people figured out that you can write human-readable text and make computers translate it to computer-readable text and then run it and suddenly have virtual and physical consequences (usually in real time) based on what's been written. And now people are making computers read human text by using special text written by humans and fed into machines so that machines could write human text like the human texts they read before by using special human-readable-computer-translated text. Do you see? It's an endless loop of textual information that's now converging on itself. The snake is eating itself. And the snake is text. The thing that was invented one billion trillion years ago. One of the simples ways that people could figure out to transmit data through time and space, through brain to brain, and now it's becoming this self-sustaining thing and it's all just text (it's all data - scream Clojure people but I can't hear them).<br /><br />Weird-weird world.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>08 Mar, 2021</h3><div>It's the 8th of March. And what am I doing? I'm tying in my text editor to see if it still works after I ran update on it. Seems to work. Seems to not throw weird error message in my console. It's 2021, god, I've been lied to all my life. No flying cars. I'm still dicking around with cables and adapters every day when I need to charge my phone. But the phone has so many cameras. 3 - I've just counted. And I have the cheaper model.<br /><br />Busses still look like busses. Some of the are electric. Most of them are not.<br /><br />I'll go to a meeting and then type some more.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>28 Feb, 2021</h3><div>I did a thought experiment yesterday that had more effect than anything Tony Robbins might say.<br /><br />It's about embarrassment. You know, that feeling, when you do something stupid in public or even in front of a single person. And then you go home and you keep feeling that feeling more and more until it becomes this embarrassment about embarrassment and you feel your face getting hot and your heart pounding. Basically you're trying to give yourself a heart attack because you did something stupid (and maybe not even intentionally stupid, like falling on your face accidentally because it was slippery).<br /><br />That feeling has been bugging me all my life. And from what I know, other people often have it. The feeling is the worst because it also inhibits your future behavior and actions. Like, you think, well, I could try talking to this person but that one time I remember I said "hi" to this guy and he's made a face and everyone stared at us... like, everyone and then he has just turned away and I was standing there like an idiot. I better not try this again. Just don't talk to people. Ever.<br /><br />And if you're like me (and since I'm writing this down for myself -- you are me!) you've also heard many times how you are the only person who remembers that kind of stuff from your past. The guy that didn't say "hello" back, the people that saw that happening -- all of them don't remember, and don't even try to remember that situation. And I always thought, yeah, that makes sense probably, but... I was still embarrassed about being embarrassed that time or another. I kept imagining people sitting in their kitchens on Saturday mornings remembering and even discussing out loud how I messed up that time, how I fell down, how I tried to make a joke and no one laughed, how I had my pants' zipper unzipped all day in front of everyone, how I was too loud and everyone hear me saying personal things about my dreams...<br /><br />So yesterday... Yeah, literally at age 36.5 I've decided to try this hat on: I've tried to remember something embarrassing that someone else did. Anyone, friend, foe or stranger. Ever. I've tried really hard. And, you've guessed it, I couldn't remember a single situation. And my memory is quite good (even now). It's so good it's often uncomfortable the amount of useless facts I remember. But I couldn't recall how anyone did something embarrassing. And while I was trying to do that I sort of understood why.... At least one of the many whys. I couldn't remember it because I haven't felt embarrassed about anything I didn't do. No, really. Think about it. Like, people say it in the movies a lot: "Oh, you've made us so embarrassed..." But even then they were embarrassed. It's like there's no empathy for embarrassment. We can feel each other's joy or sadness or, of course, pain. But... we cannot feel each other's embarrassment that well or at all. Or even if we do it's so... transient that we don't remember any of it. And we were probably embarrassed ourselves in the beginning anyway.<br /><br />Now, I could remember one situation. About my friend peeing in my bed at night that one time he stayed over because his parents were away. We were like 10 or 11 years old. And the only reason I can remember it is that every time I meet him now, which happens every several years, he keeps retelling me that story. I don't know why, but telling that story makes him really happy. So I guess it's not even an embarrassing story. And when I recalled it I didn't really feel embarrassed about him or me. It was just this story from my childhood. Not the worst story either.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're reading this, you're not me and you have this problem with keep remembering your own embarrassing moments, try the experiment -- switch roles and see for yourself. No one remembers this stuff outside themselves. Now you are free, go an embarrass the fuck out of you!<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>23 Feb, 2021</h3><div>The great youtube random video generator (AKA artificial intelligence algorithm that costs one trillion megabucks) put this into my headphones. Yeah, I wasn't even looking at the video, it was just playing music to me starting with Moby... and then this happened:<br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1wgaFJ0750" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />I like it. It's haunting. Makes you feel like something from not of this world will knock on your door in a few seconds. And make you choose: stay safe and die old with a whole on your under pants, or go and die young in suffering and become a verse in an old creepy song.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>22 Feb, 2021</h3><div>It was 1995. It was 5 years before the end of the world. It was summer. Crazy appleseeds were hanging from a great chestnut tree standing between two small windows. The windows smelled of onion. The appleseeds smiled lots and lots. They were crazy every summer. Till the world changed.<br /><br />It was 1996. Summer got hotter. Trees were no fun anymore. Pixels were fun. Strategizing was fun. Mashing buttons was fun. Appleseeds were pleased with life of simplicity. They needed a TV, some cookies, a lot of water and a pinch of electricity. No Internet was required. No subscriptions services or avocado toasts. No motivational speaker. It was them, non-blinking, smiling, in awe every 50 minutes or so. Information traveled from balcony to ear to legs to balcony. Fast, cheap, low-tech, low-bandwidth. Pixels told good stories. Appleseeds were happy. School was a couple of months away. The end of the world was 4 years away.<br /><br />It was 1997. While the world moved and shacked and got connected and re-connected and learned how to punch itself and make soap and rap... The appleseeds learned some new words, looked at images on paper and were riding the pixels every-freaking-day-no-school-no-parents-no-girlfriends-no-boyfriends-no-diets-no-taxes-no-deadlines-no-career-ladders-no-children-with-diapers... nothing could stop them. And nothing did.<br /><br />2000 came. Yeah, I've skipped a few summers. They were mostly good. No such thing as a bad summer, right? 2000 came and stopped them. Yeah. Without lifting a finger, without crashing the Wall Street, without flooding the world with fire and water and self-navigating-exploding-squirrels-that-are-also-ninjas. It just came and went. And took the crazy appleseeds with it. Leaving a lot of tobacco smell, a puddle of saliva mixed with tears one-to-one and some really bad poetry.<br /><br />It's 2021 today. I am not going back. I just can't.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>09 Feb, 2021</h3><div>So, a funny thing has happened.<br /><br />We came to Oslo and went into quarantine right away. It was mandatory and we were also thinking: it will do us good to spend 10 days relaxing at home, going for nature walks and investigating the selection of the nearby supermarket (Rema 1000 chain - I love when there are thousands in names, like Ziggy 3000, etc.). We were also staying in an apartment on the outskirts of Oslo, on a small mountain. There were almost no people, a lot of trees and snow and one road that was mostly used by buses and trucks. Oh, there was also a church and a tiny graveyard. What I'm trying to say that the place was only officially part of Oslo, but it wasn't Oslo city and if you didn't remind yourself that you're in Oslo you might as well be in Canada or Magadan.<br /><br />During our first days we've received an sms from... well, from Oslo itself. The sms was in English and said that the coronavirus is spreading so everything will be closed except the farmacies, the grocery stores and schools (but only because they will switch to code red operations, whatever that means). We thought: cool, they sent sms even to people with non-Norwegian phone numbers and the sms are in English. The lockdown sounded more like what we were used to in Berlin, we were not phased by that.<br /><br />But, the quarantine has ended and the airbnb hose went crazy and we needed to go to Oslo, like, the city center, the National Theater area, to print out some papers, buy some envelopes (we switched from doing everything digitally online to doing everything German style with paper and snail mail thanks to this one asshole whose name doesn't deserve to be called on the pages of this monologue). Anyway, we were rushing to get the printout and the envelopes -- end of Saturday and on Sunday most of the places are closed (German style, again). We were able to finish all the side-quests and decided to take a slow stroll back to the station to head home (to our new airbnb flat with the nicest owner). And then we've noticed... Nothing is closed in Oslo. Nothing. The feeling was weird and it took us a couple of blocks of walking to realize: we haven't seen a big street looking like that in more than a year! All the stores were open. People were walking without masks on. Folks were sitting in cafes and restaurants (with extra distance between the tables though). It was like... coming to a foreign country for the first time after you've spent your whole life in a post-soviet (or even soviet) country. Look at all the stores, look at all the people buying stuff, look at the choices and the lights and the names.<br /><br />But what about the official SMS and the news on the web that said that we have a lockdown in Oslo?! I don't know. Was it a lie? A misscomunication? A misunderstanding on my part? (Yeah, my English is not very good, I am sorry!). Or, like my friend Benjamin said, maybe they tell this to newcomers so they would stay home while the rest of the nation enjoys their home decoration shopping and their special Swedish February buns called "semla".<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>05 Feb, 2021</h3><div>Note to self: never rent an airbnb flat from a crazy person.<br /><br />Sleeping with the bedroom door closed from the inside just in case. If we were in US I would've had a shotgun under my pillow. But... this is Norge! I mean Norway! We don't have guns under our pillows. We have a moose in the backyard, bacon cheese in a tube and quiet cold that works better than any freaking diet I have ever tried.<br /><br />Anyway, the escape route is set and if we live to see the morning light rising over the neighboring mountains we will get to a new flat, where the owner is human and sensible. Only then we can start doing what we should've done already -- setting up the documents, the great electronic persona of Scandinavia and also do some work!<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>29 Jan, 2021</h3><div>And we're back!<br /><br />Now, in Norway. The snow outside is everywhere. The cold is persistent, strong and... surprisingly fun. I have been getting myself more and more familiar with the cold after I moved from Thailand to Germany and discovered I can finally have proper cold showers. After that I started sleeping under a thinner blanket during the winter time, otherwise I couldn't sleep because I was too hot and too sweaty. With the window open and the heating turned off.<br /><br />So, obviously cold has become a sort of a friend. And now, rediscovering the Wim Hof method that I've used in Thailand everytime I felt flue-like symptoms, I'm getting in a more intense relationship with cold. Also now the cold is not this small tiny creature in the corner but a bigger beast ready to bite your head of if you show any signs of fear.<br /><br />Fun times. Also the shower is much colder here during winter time. So I'm having all kinds of fun painful experiences while trying not to go into shock.<br /><br />Other than that... the amounts of coffee I can drink without effect on my sleep is now unlimited. I do need to find a thinner blanket though. The current airbnb apartment has one of those super synthetic, light but fat and non-breathable blankets. I wake up sweaty even though the window is open and it's -16 C outside. Ruining my beauty sleep!<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>11 Jan, 2021</h3><div>I've stumbled upon a practical way of using average numbers in real life.<br /><br />Yeah, I know what an average is, but to be honest I have never seen a lot of<br />sense of using it in real life. Unless you are splitting the bill into equal<br />parts or something. But that happens less frequently these days.<br /><br />But, reading this book about information theory today, I've noticed a fun way to<br />use average numbers.<br /><br />Let's try some examples.<br /><br />Example one:<br /><br />I live in a country where average salary is 5$. I know that my salary is 7$.<br />This automatically means that there must be at least one person that has a<br />salary that is less than 5$. Probably around 3$. And the higher my salary is in<br />comparison to the known average (that is probably reported in the news every<br />year either to brag or to shock the readers even if the readers are the same<br />people that write the news) the lower the salary of someone else in the same<br />country.<br /><br />[It's probably obvious to some math-brained people, but it wasn't to me, so shut<br />up!]<br /><br />Example two:<br /><br />If an average life span of a human is 59 years (a number that I've just<br />invented) and you go to a cemetery and find a grave stone of a child that was<br />alive for only 5 days... there must be a person in the world who is waaaaay<br />older than 59 years (I'm too lazy to calculate but you get the idea).<br /><br />What do it all mean to me?<br /><br />I'm not trying to be philosophical about it (although I can). I'm just seeing<br />this cool way of getting a quick sure information about the world by knowing<br />just two numbers, when one of those numbers is an average and the other one is a<br />sample from that average. Makes me appreciate math (which I usually don't do<br />often). And makes me a bit scared when I think up more and more example based on<br />my personal data and the average numbers.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>06 Jan, 2021</h3><div>Sometimes when I'm walking outside (in 3d and full color) and passing near a bus<br />stop I see someone rushing towards the bus that has been standing there for a<br />few moments already with opened doors. People have already finished loading into<br />the bus. I can feel the doors beginning to close, the driver not seeing that<br />there's a person outside in the cold unfriendly street doing the best she can to<br />make it, running (maybe for the first time in years) with bags dangling in her<br />arms hitting her knees and messing up with her rhythm. And then... sometimes,<br />not every time, that rushing someone makes it to the bus. In these moments I<br />forget about most of the things. In these moments a wave of satisfaction and<br />warmness rushes over me. I feel good about the person that's made it onto the<br />bus in the last moment. I feel good about the driver. I feel good about the<br />other passengers. I feel good about people standing outside, seeing the same<br />small... miracle.<br /><br />It works with trams as well. It doesn't work with trains or subways.<br /></div></div></div>        </code>    </body></html>
