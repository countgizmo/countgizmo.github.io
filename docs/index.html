I guess that's why I haven't. I've<br />been falling down the rabbit whole into the world of Casey Muratori and Jonathan<br />Blow (and everything related).<br /><br />Now, I've already written about my Handmade Hero discovery and my SDL2 coding<br />attempts, which are still bringing me joy and frustration, but mostly joy. It's<br />all kind of related but even I cannot remember at this point what happened<br />first.<br /><br />Just watch this: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZSRHeXYDLko" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />It's a great talk, isn't it? It's also sad because it's true. I have been<br />thinking about this topic for awhile now, especially lately when I've noticed<br />that we spend more time and effort talking about whitespace and comments<br />formatting than we do about performance. To be honest we do get to performance,<br />but... It's not the first thing on our agenda (and maybe it shouldn't be). But I<br />have noticed that fewer and fewer programmers that I personally know spend time<br />writing software closer to hardware, high performing software.<br /><br />But let's not point fingers. I'm a great example of being part of the problem.<br /><br />So... I have a need of some custom made software. And I (following the steps of<br />my grandfather) build my own stuff when I need it. When I wanted a program that<br />would generate random workouts for me (from one of the great Pavel's programs),<br />I wrote it myself. When I wanted a helper program for my guitar studies, I wrote<br />another one. When I wanted a super simple monologuing service, I wrote my own.<br /><br />But I did it all as web apps. Which could be OK if the plant was to make it<br />public and share with the world. But it was always just for me. So instead of<br />writing a program that's small, fast, doesn't require a whole web stack and a<br />deployment process I've went with an "easy" solution: at the end of the day I do<br />spend most of my time doing fullstack web apps.<br /><br />And then I saw this talk. And then I saw more of John Blow's talks and listened<br />to Casey in some podcasts. And I got sad. And I've tried to write C and I was<br />scared of C. And that's when it got me.... Me? Afraid of C? I've made my first<br />money programming in C. I wrote my bachelor's work in C. I studied C in the<br />university. I was never scared of C. But now I was.... I felt vulnerable without<br />a garbage collector. I'm not even trying to be funny. It was what I felt.<br /><br />So... That was it. That was the point that kicked me in the face. Did I lose it?<br />Am I really a software developer? Have I regressed after my university years?<br /><br />I guess I'm trying to say: I'll be writing software for myself in C. And it will<br />be executables that I can run on my local machine without an internet<br />connection. (SDL2 will help for sure.) And I'm actually excited about that.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>26 Mar, 2021</h3><div>I've been recently doing some C coding with SDL2. Just following the handmade hero videos and trying to reimplement some of the basic ideas like:<br />- open a window<br />- put pixels on window<br />- put pixels in a back buffer and copy that buffer to the window's buffer<br /><br />That's where I am at right now. I don't have a deadline or a plan. I just enjoy the process of discovering how basic gamedev and computer graphics work without the help of a framework. I do use SDL2, cause I'm on Mac and it seems to be the best thing to use when you want a "lower" level access to graphics and such but don't want to build everything from scratch. I think at this point I enjoy learning about how games work more than playing them. To be honest I haven't played anything since one year ago when I had insomnia and one night tried to play the original Zelda and couldn't achieve any progress and gotten frustrated. I'm sure 12 yo me would've had more success but he's not around anymore. He's gone. Surfing the waves of the quantum information field of nowhere.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>25 Mar, 2021</h3><div>Billy Strings got a Grammy for him "Home" albumn.<br /><br />This is a good things.<br /><br />Warm days have started to pile-up in Norway. It's already hard to find snow in Oslo, but in my neighbourhood... it still looks like deep winter in other countries I know.<br /><br />I have discovered a world of tiled window managers... for MacOS. Helps a lot when you have a million windows to manage and only<br />one big monitor. The monitor has enough space for everything... but how does one figure out the windows placement... Tiled window managers, man... That's the truth.<br /><br />I just wanted to test my auto site building one more time really. Nothing to see here :)<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>23 Mar, 2021</h3><div>I'm basically testing the githubactions CI thing I've created.<br />This should help me build the site easier: I commit a new thought (as a wondeful text file) and then magic happens and I have one less thing to do.<br />Next step is to make it easier to generate new empty thoughts on my local computer, but that's something for the future me.<br /><br />In other news: the weather is wonderful, the coffee is consumed outside in the garden chair, the snow is melting... I guess you can call it fast for Norway.<br />I've been thinking: since a lot of people got into playing chess after watching (binging) the Queen's Gambit show... maybe it will level up the humanity's capabilities for deep concentration, improve the cognitive skills and so on. And smarter future humanity will realise all their mistakes, fix them and finally create flying cars powered by thoughts. Maybe?<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>09 Mar, 2021</h3><div>"One of the most valuable unicorns in the world" - actual phrase I would never expect to read in a serious media. But that's the world we live in. We have valuable unicorns. And there's obviously a competition amongst them.<br /><br />In other news... AIs writing news articles after 2 seconds of the actual event happening. Journalists? Who are they?<br /><br />I was thinking about text yesterday. People came up with the idea of writing stuff down and then reading that stuff consistently. Then other people figured out that you can write human-readable text and make computers translate it to computer-readable text and then run it and suddenly have virtual and physical consequences (usually in real time) based on what's been written. And now people are making computers read human text by using special text written by humans and fed into machines so that machines could write human text like the human texts they read before by using special human-readable-computer-translated text. Do you see? It's an endless loop of textual information that's now converging on itself. The snake is eating itself. And the snake is text. The thing that was invented one billion trillion years ago. One of the simples ways that people could figure out to transmit data through time and space, through brain to brain, and now it's becoming this self-sustaining thing and it's all just text (it's all data - scream Clojure people but I can't hear them).<br /><br />Weird-weird world.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>08 Mar, 2021</h3><div>It's the 8th of March. And what am I doing? I'm tying in my text editor to see if it still works after I ran update on it. Seems to work. Seems to not throw weird error message in my console. It's 2021, god, I've been lied to all my life. No flying cars. I'm still dicking around with cables and adapters every day when I need to charge my phone. But the phone has so many cameras. 3 - I've just counted. And I have the cheaper model.<br /><br />Busses still look like busses. Some of the are electric. Most of them are not.<br /><br />I'll go to a meeting and then type some more.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>28 Feb, 2021</h3><div>I did a thought experiment yesterday that had more effect than anything Tony Robbins might say.<br /><br />It's about embarrassment. You know, that feeling, when you do something stupid in public or even in front of a single person. And then you go home and you keep feeling that feeling more and more until it becomes this embarrassment about embarrassment and you feel your face getting hot and your heart pounding. Basically you're trying to give yourself a heart attack because you did something stupid (and maybe not even intentionally stupid, like falling on your face accidentally because it was slippery).<br /><br />That feeling has been bugging me all my life. And from what I know, other people often have it. The feeling is the worst because it also inhibits your future behavior and actions. Like, you think, well, I could try talking to this person but that one time I remember I said "hi" to this guy and he's made a face and everyone stared at us... like, everyone and then he has just turned away and I was standing there like an idiot. I better not try this again. Just don't talk to people. Ever.<br /><br />And if you're like me (and since I'm writing this down for myself -- you are me!) you've also heard many times how you are the only person who remembers that kind of stuff from your past. The guy that didn't say "hello" back, the people that saw that happening -- all of them don't remember, and don't even try to remember that situation. And I always thought, yeah, that makes sense probably, but... I was still embarrassed about being embarrassed that time or another. I kept imagining people sitting in their kitchens on Saturday mornings remembering and even discussing out loud how I messed up that time, how I fell down, how I tried to make a joke and no one laughed, how I had my pants' zipper unzipped all day in front of everyone, how I was too loud and everyone hear me saying personal things about my dreams...<br /><br />So yesterday... Yeah, literally at age 36.5 I've decided to try this hat on: I've tried to remember something embarrassing that someone else did. Anyone, friend, foe or stranger. Ever. I've tried really hard. And, you've guessed it, I couldn't remember a single situation. And my memory is quite good (even now). It's so good it's often uncomfortable the amount of useless facts I remember. But I couldn't recall how anyone did something embarrassing. And while I was trying to do that I sort of understood why.... At least one of the many whys. I couldn't remember it because I haven't felt embarrassed about anything I didn't do. No, really. Think about it. Like, people say it in the movies a lot: "Oh, you've made us so embarrassed..." But even then they were embarrassed. It's like there's no empathy for embarrassment. We can feel each other's joy or sadness or, of course, pain. But... we cannot feel each other's embarrassment that well or at all. Or even if we do it's so... transient that we don't remember any of it. And we were probably embarrassed ourselves in the beginning anyway.<br /><br />Now, I could remember one situation. About my friend peeing in my bed at night that one time he stayed over because his parents were away. We were like 10 or 11 years old. And the only reason I can remember it is that every time I meet him now, which happens every several years, he keeps retelling me that story. I don't know why, but telling that story makes him really happy. So I guess it's not even an embarrassing story. And when I recalled it I didn't really feel embarrassed about him or me. It was just this story from my childhood. Not the worst story either.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're reading this, you're not me and you have this problem with keep remembering your own embarrassing moments, try the experiment -- switch roles and see for yourself. No one remembers this stuff outside themselves. Now you are free, go an embarrass the fuck out of you!<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>23 Feb, 2021</h3><div>The great youtube random video generator (AKA artificial intelligence algorithm that costs one trillion megabucks) put this into my headphones. Yeah, I wasn't even looking at the video, it was just playing music to me starting with Moby... and then this happened:<br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1wgaFJ0750" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />I like it. It's haunting. Makes you feel like something from not of this world will knock on your door in a few seconds. And make you choose: stay safe and die old with a whole on your under pants, or go and die young in suffering and become a verse in an old creepy song.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>22 Feb, 2021</h3><div>It was 1995. It was 5 years before the end of the world. It was summer. Crazy appleseeds were hanging from a great chestnut tree standing between two small windows. The windows smelled of onion. The appleseeds smiled lots and lots. They were crazy every summer. Till the world changed.<br /><br />It was 1996. Summer got hotter. Trees were no fun anymore. Pixels were fun. Strategizing was fun. Mashing buttons was fun. Appleseeds were pleased with life of simplicity. They needed a TV, some cookies, a lot of water and a pinch of electricity. No Internet was required. No subscriptions services or avocado toasts. No motivational speaker. It was them, non-blinking, smiling, in awe every 50 minutes or so. Information traveled from balcony to ear to legs to balcony. Fast, cheap, low-tech, low-bandwidth. Pixels told good stories. Appleseeds were happy. School was a couple of months away. The end of the world was 4 years away.<br /><br />It was 1997. While the world moved and shacked and got connected and re-connected and learned how to punch itself and make soap and rap... The appleseeds learned some new words, looked at images on paper and were riding the pixels every-freaking-day-no-school-no-parents-no-girlfriends-no-boyfriends-no-diets-no-taxes-no-deadlines-no-career-ladders-no-children-with-diapers... nothing could stop them. And nothing did.<br /><br />2000 came. Yeah, I've skipped a few summers. They were mostly good. No such thing as a bad summer, right? 2000 came and stopped them. Yeah. Without lifting a finger, without crashing the Wall Street, without flooding the world with fire and water and self-navigating-exploding-squirrels-that-are-also-ninjas. It just came and went. And took the crazy appleseeds with it. Leaving a lot of tobacco smell, a puddle of saliva mixed with tears one-to-one and some really bad poetry.<br /><br />It's 2021 today. I am not going back. I just can't.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>09 Feb, 2021</h3><div>So, a funny thing has happened.<br /><br />We came to Oslo and went into quarantine right away. It was mandatory and we were also thinking: it will do us good to spend 10 days relaxing at home, going for nature walks and investigating the selection of the nearby supermarket (Rema 1000 chain - I love when there are thousands in names, like Ziggy 3000, etc.). We were also staying in an apartment on the outskirts of Oslo, on a small mountain. There were almost no people, a lot of trees and snow and one road that was mostly used by buses and trucks. Oh, there was also a church and a tiny graveyard. What I'm trying to say that the place was only officially part of Oslo, but it wasn't Oslo city and if you didn't remind yourself that you're in Oslo you might as well be in Canada or Magadan.<br /><br />During our first days we've received an sms from... well, from Oslo itself. The sms was in English and said that the coronavirus is spreading so everything will be closed except the farmacies, the grocery stores and schools (but only because they will switch to code red operations, whatever that means). We thought: cool, they sent sms even to people with non-Norwegian phone numbers and the sms are in English. The lockdown sounded more like what we were used to in Berlin, we were not phased by that.<br /><br />But, the quarantine has ended and the airbnb hose went crazy and we needed to go to Oslo, like, the city center, the National Theater area, to print out some papers, buy some envelopes (we switched from doing everything digitally online to doing everything German style with paper and snail mail thanks to this one asshole whose name doesn't deserve to be called on the pages of this monologue). Anyway, we were rushing to get the printout and the envelopes -- end of Saturday and on Sunday most of the places are closed (German style, again). We were able to finish all the side-quests and decided to take a slow stroll back to the station to head home (to our new airbnb flat with the nicest owner). And then we've noticed... Nothing is closed in Oslo. Nothing. The feeling was weird and it took us a couple of blocks of walking to realize: we haven't seen a big street looking like that in more than a year! All the stores were open. People were walking without masks on. Folks were sitting in cafes and restaurants (with extra distance between the tables though). It was like... coming to a foreign country for the first time after you've spent your whole life in a post-soviet (or even soviet) country. Look at all the stores, look at all the people buying stuff, look at the choices and the lights and the names.<br /><br />But what about the official SMS and the news on the web that said that we have a lockdown in Oslo?! I don't know. Was it a lie? A misscomunication? A misunderstanding on my part? (Yeah, my English is not very good, I am sorry!). Or, like my friend Benjamin said, maybe they tell this to newcomers so they would stay home while the rest of the nation enjoys their home decoration shopping and their special Swedish February buns called "semla".<br /></div></div></div>        </code>    </body></html>
