Even if it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUmLRMERmJrmUtgnbFfknAg">Randy</a> banging on a keyboard and yelling at a badly rendered 3D figure. I will watch his video and immediately want to code something myself. Most of the time it's... work stuff but sometimes it's a graphical timer written in C or yet another web app for budgeting, guitar training, progress tracking...<br /><br />I even get motivated by reading about other people's work. I've been recently going through "The Dream Machine" and the prologue itself made me excited about getting back to the good ol' 'puter and program something new and exciting (probably a bugfix for that pesky browser back button).<br /><br />And now I'm thinking. I get motivated by seeing other people doing stuff. And since I'm definitely not special, others are motivated the same way. That means... A long-long-long-long-really-freaking-long time ago there was a mutated monkey standing upright twiddling its thumbs, cause what else are they good for. But unlike all the other mutated monkeys it's suddenly started to do something... creative. Maybe a rock was looking less like a rock and more like a.... round thing... that's really good at rolling, so if you bang it against another rock to make it even more round like... Nah, it wasn't probably the wheel or a wheel at first. It was probably something to do with sticks... That's it, the monkey was making the world's first ever shit-on-a-stick! It doesn't really matter, the point being, it was doing something creative. Not working, but creating.<br /><br />And there were several mutated monkeys standing beside the creative one. They were all twiddling their thumbs of course, thinking: "What a waste of thumbs twiddling thumbs..." And maybe even yelling something loud in a primal feat of existential rage: "Stop being creative! It will all end badly!" And there was probably on more mutated monkey, probably the one in the back row, that was feeling that it too wanted to attach shit to a stick. It was itching to try it and it did. And then it did it another way, or tried to attached two shits to one stick and then two sticks to one shit...<br /><br />I am pretty sure that this whole creativity bit started like that. And now we have computers that can show us videos of other computers dancing. None has any wires attached.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>05 Aug, 2021</h3><div>This is one of those posts when I'm feeling all smart and stuff cause I have discovered this magic thing called water.<br /><br />But I do want to write this down. For the sake of writing it down.<br /><br />I've been thinking about success lately. My success. Humble, not-generating-any-headlines success. And also failures. Cause you cannot have one without the other. And I've noticed a theme. I have been successful, in a big life-changing way, twice: 1. I've became a software developer (a coder, a programmer, a question-mark-shaped-button-pusher, an engineer, although that last point is still being argued questioned and laughed at by the real engineers); 2. My fitness level at 37 is not... terrible, especially for being a professional benchwarmer (I literally get paid for sitting on my ass... productively). I have also failed so many times, that my ego won't let me give any examples here publicly (also, it's boring to write and read about things-that-could-have-happened-but-did-not). But one of those: I wanted to be a writer. As in, writing fiction, stories for people to read and enjoy. I've spent 5 years doing that (writing daily in the mornings and sometimes evenings, making everything else second priority to my writing, etc.). I wrote one good short story and got published and got me _some_ very-very-very-very narrow recognition at a retreat for young writers (I wasn't 37 back then, more like.... 31).<br /><br />And I think I know why success happened and why failure happened. In those particular cases. It's easy... and a bit hard to admit. But, I've became a professional software engineer because I liked coding. I wasn't good at it, but I liked the process. I was getting into the mythical flow state, I was losing track of time, I enjoyed reading computer science books instead of a yet another Stevie King's novel. I didn't care if I ever become a software engineer. I just wanted to code. And when I got an opportunity to do this _and_ I got paid for it... well, that just meant that now I can write code even more! No worrying about paying bills, helping mom, buying shit I don't need to prove to myself I'm not poor anymore (oops, psychological problems overflowing, must. stop. must. focus.) I am also one of those weird mutant people that actually truly enjoy working out. As in, intensive, "I is gonna puke nowz!", working out. Not because I "want to look good nekkid" but because I really-really like the process, how I feel during the time I workout, how I feel before, after. And it's the same deal as with programming: I enjoy reading training manuals and memoirs of some coach or athlete, I read through forums on muscle-building obsessed websites, I spend more money then the most people on things like supplements, kettlebells, resistance bands, push-up handles, ab-rollers, massage and mobility doodads. I even had an olympic size barbell in my apartment. Apartment! Like, small one! (The length of an olympic barbell is 220 cm and it weights 20 kg... and if you don't understand the metric system... I mean, it's 2021... there's this things called science... anyway... enjoy your new pickup truck).<br /><br />And I failed as a writer cause at some point, quite early actually, I've stopped enjoying the process and started pursuing this vision of... me being a famous author that people recognise on the street, come to book stores to meet and get a signed copy of the latest super-bestseller that only my brilliant mind could produce. And it's very hard, at least for me, to do anything good enough if I don't enjoy the process and only looking for the rewards, the outcomes of that process. It's like washing dishes... I'm not going to concentrate and make sure every plate is clean and rinsed and dried and placed in a correct sizing order on a correct plate holding place... I'm just going to rush through it and then wonder the next day why the food tastes so soapy.<br /><br />I guess the morale, if there is any, is that: enjoy the process. And if you don't enjoy the process, don't bother hoping for great things to happen. Also try to bail out and try something else. Or even a crazier idea... maybe try to learn to like the process you're already doing. Maybe stop waiting for the pay day. Is it possible? I don't know. I've hated programming for many years (yep, when I was the brilliant writer no one knows about), I've found a way to enjoy it again. The outcome doesn't really matter. It's the same for everyone. There's no surprise ending. You're not in a M Night Shyamalan's flick.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>04 May, 2021</h3><div>... on the other hand, the food tastes so good after 36 hours of none of it. And I'm choosing only the best, tastiest things in the fridge, cause if I have a limit (and we all do have a limit, we just forget that we do) I'm making sure I get the most goodness and pleasureness.<br /><br />It's not all doom and gloom though. During those 36 hours I mean. At least if you have something intellectual to occupy yourself with: coding, reading, thinking, gaming, etc. My focus is way deeper and easier to achieve during the prolonged fasting period. And everything becomes much more interesting. Just make sure you're not reading a novel written by a decadent French chef called "The Last Food Orgasm" while you're fasting. Cyberpunk works great - there's not a single tasty thing that was ever present in a cyberpunk story. Math books are great! Programming is nice cause you just get into the code editor and start thinking about each letter of code with great intensity. Cause... what else are you going to do?<br /><br />Anyway... it's easier to write about it now, on Tuesday, which is not Monday. I've already had my home-made sugar-free berry jello. And I'm gonna have a fat-coffee with vanilla whey protein. And then I'm gonna think of a nice dish with meat and veggies and tons of fat. It's raining outside and I can eat till it's like 6-7 PM. Seize the plate, Luke!<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>03 May, 2021</h3><div>Monday. Darkness and despair. What have you done this weekend? Have you achieved happiness? Have you made progress on your personal development, your side hustles, your projects? Have you lived every second like it's the last one? You know... All that bullcrap that supposed to motivate you but actually makes you sad and depressed.<br /><br />Mondays are the worst. They are reminders. To some of us not all. You work because you get paid. Even if you love your job. It's still a job. There's no escape. It's a trap and it's closed a long time ago, before your parents have even decided to have sex for the first time. So it's not your fault. But you get to live this horrible mess until you die and then... There's nothing, but you should definitely pick up a religion so that it doesn't feel like a complete senseless joke.<br /><br />Mondays, man. Can it get any worse? Well, ol' chump, I'm so glad you've asked. I, me, myself have singlehandedly found a way to make Mondays even worse. Like... Mondays on steroids. You wanna know how I did it don't you? You wanna follow me into the abyss? Fine!<br /><br />So... I've started doing this intermittent fasting thing a long time ago (before it got trendy, like it's the new vegetarianism, goddammit!). And now I got to my latest experiment with it: 36 hours of no food starting.... Sunday night. Yeah, no food all Monday. And food is one of those things that's kind like cocaine for the rich rock starts that snorted themselves out of this world by the time they got to celebrate their 28th birthdays. Maybe they did things right. Anyway, food that helps me not be sad (dopamine mostly, but who's counting) is not available to me in the darkest hours of a workweek. Am I a genius or what?<br /><br />Half of today's Monday is gone already. I'm not thinking about food though. I'm thinking about Clojurescript, CSS and escape routes from the trap. And I know there's no escape but I cannot help not thinking about it. Especially when I'm not eating and it's cold and raining.<br /><br />I totally recommend it!<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>30 Apr, 2021</h3><div>I'll be watching a youtube video, right? A really good one. Like, a person clearly spent a lot of time preparing the material, synthesising the interesting bits, figuring out a way on how to simplify it and present as a 10 minute (or 20 minute if presenter is someone born in USA), making the video, editing it, etc. And then I scroll to the comment section and there will be a comment like "You are an idiot and your mom is fat!" Or something even more terrible, like "You are totally wrong, lol!", which is like the whole reason the Internet exists, right? Telling people they are wrong...<br /><br />Or there will be comments for someone's insta photos or someone's drawing, someone's song or even someone's indie game. And the comments will just be violent, stupid and 100% negative (funnily enough, most of the start with "I don't want to sound like a jerk, buuut...").<br /><br />And I think I know the reason. Like, the mechanical reason. No psycho-emotional-artsy-fartsy-bull-shit. Mechanically, it's takes a lot of effort to make something, like a video, and it takes even more effort to publish it, especially if it includes the author herself or even just the voice (we all know how we feel when we hear our own voice recorded secretly and suddenly played back to us). And it's waaaay easy to just click inside the comment box and start typing and then hit "send" or "Save" or whatever. Most of the times you don't even need to register or login to leave a comment. So if you wanna be mean, it's really easy to be mean. Even being accidentally mean is so easy it's sometimes unavoidable (I did it several times, cause I didn't take good care of what I was trying to say and just typed and submit and then hurt someone's feelings for no reason except my stupidity).<br /><br />The answer might be: balance things out. Make commenting as difficult. One way that I can see is: if you want to comment on some video on youtube you must have published public videos, at least ten of those, real ones (just for example). The same goes for other platforms where people publish their art, work or artwork. Then you know what it's like to show your work to everyone, you know what goes into making that work and you probably are more experienced and ready to comment on some work from the same media. Also the receiving author will know that you're not just a random dood from cyberspace, bored and horrible, but you might actually know what you're talking about cause otherwise you wouldn't have the feature to comment.<br /><br />As a software developer I find it's also easy to implement, so I don't see why not have a system of ... basically rank. Nobody gets to post nothing. An author can engage in conversation with other authors. And even then it might depend on the ranking system. Like: you posted 10 videos... you can like/dislike other videos, you posted 10 more, you can leave emojis, you posted a 100, now you get to write comments with like words and sentences and exclamation points.<br /><br />And I know, some people fuel their ego or just get motivated by reading comments like "you're great!", but I think (and I'm just a horrible nobody) that this is not a good motivation. The motivation should come from you digging the process and having some vision or just experimenting cause you enjoy it or just getting to practice a craft. The motivation should never come from your drinking buddies cheering you on. A lot of great work/art was done behind closed doors, in bedrooms offline, inside minds and empty hallways, on a bus while commuting to work for the millionth time. Without any comments.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>29 Apr, 2021</h3><div>I want to talk about Apple. Cause why not. Everyone's doing it. There are whole sub-genres of podcasts dedicated to talking about Apple. Seriously, how valuable is that?<br /><br />So I wanna jump in and complain and criticise something I haven't even tried to do: create and sell expensive products to trillions and trillions of people in all countries, rich or poor.<br /><br />The last online keynote presentation thing made me think new thoughts. While ten keynotes before that cause absolutely zero thoughts in my brain. So might as well write them down.<br /><br />I see an issue. And it's probably my personal issue but here it goes... Image, I don't have a computer and I want one. Just one. Cause I've heard that it's 2021 and you only need one and I don't have that much money. So I want a computer. Kind of like when people wanted a VCR they didn't want 5 VCRs, they wanted one. It was so straightforward that you didn't have to mention it to anyone: you either had one and you wanted a new one or you had zero and you wanted A one.<br /><br />So I want a computer and I've heard nice things about Apple. And I vaguely remember the rebel spirit of underdog Apple of the late nineteen-ninety-X. And I go to their website, cause the stores are all in lockdown and I forgot how to use walk-in stores and how to talk to people... like ... without Zoom??? How's it even possible?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm on their website-online-shop-thing and I want a computer. And....<br /><br />-- Hey, Apple!<br />-- Whatup dood?<br />-- Sell me a computer. A good one.<br />-- OK, which one do you want?<br />-- I don't know. I want a good one I guess. I've just told you that, right?<br />-- Don't need to be so touchy. I got ya! Do you want a big screen or a small one?<br />-- I don't know. I wanted a computer, I didn't think about screens. I guess a big one is better, right?<br />-- For sure! You should get an iMac.<br />-- Great! Is it heavy? Cause you know, I move around a lot. Every 2 years I pack my stuff and relocate to another planet.<br />-- Digital Nomad ay?<br />-- Don't call me that! I hate that term. They always show lazy hipsters in Thailand pretending they're coding in their swimsuit. Have you tried coding on a beach... in Thailand?<br />-- Nah man, I don't travel much. I'm from California, USA! The best country in the nation!<br />-- Right. So... iMac... heavy?<br />-- Not exactly. But.... you can't just take it with you. I mean, you can, but you need a desk and an electrical outlet to plug it in.<br />-- Doesn't sound right. It's 2021, don't you have a portable computer?<br />-- Do I! I have MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. And like... the biggest one is 16 inches! It has a battery and you can try coding from a beach in Thailand... until it overheats and powers down in 2 seconds. That's what you wanted, right?<br />-- Yeah! Is it heavy though?<br />-- Depends on whom you ask. You know, I workout. Like, lots! So for me it's not heavy at all. Check this out, see these biceps? All natty!<br />-- Ok-ok. I've heard you can like ... touch screens for some reason. Can I touch those screens on MacBooks?<br />-- Hell no! This is like... super uncool. Only Microsoft does that. And who wants Microsoft's anything, right? You feel me?<br />-- Ok... Do you have a portable computer that's not heavy (I don't workout lots) and that I can touch screens with?<br />-- I have an iPad.... Pro! I also have an iPad Air. And just iPad.<br />-- Ok, what's wrong with those?<br />-- They are kind of not computers. You get your software from my app store. And you want something else... you need to code it yourself I guess. In machine code... while blindfolded. And you need a special keyboard-case thing for typing this long-ass blog posts you like. It's not included by the way.<br />-- Ok, what's the difference between all the iPads...?<br />...<br /><br />And so it goes forever and ever. Until one of you gives up. And it's probably you. And you either buy something... randomly. Or you close the website-online-shop thing from Apple and open another one. Which is much easier to do than to go around the city from one location to another.<br /><br />This is my problem. The product line is so huge, complex and highly overlapping. And at the same time every product missing some valuable bit that's present in another product but that other product is almost missing some bit... For no good reason except for money-generating-capitalism-is-so-nice-yo reason.<br /><br />I hope I won't need a new computer that I would have to chose and buy myself anytime soon.<br /><br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>26 Apr, 2021</h3><div>I wanted to post it here for a long time now. I guess that's why I haven't. I've<br />been falling down the rabbit whole into the world of Casey Muratori and Jonathan<br />Blow (and everything related).<br /><br />Now, I've already written about my Handmade Hero discovery and my SDL2 coding<br />attempts, which are still bringing me joy and frustration, but mostly joy. It's<br />all kind of related but even I cannot remember at this point what happened<br />first.<br /><br />Just watch this: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZSRHeXYDLko" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />It's a great talk, isn't it? It's also sad because it's true. I have been<br />thinking about this topic for awhile now, especially lately when I've noticed<br />that we spend more time and effort talking about whitespace and comments<br />formatting than we do about performance. To be honest we do get to performance,<br />but... It's not the first thing on our agenda (and maybe it shouldn't be). But I<br />have noticed that fewer and fewer programmers that I personally know spend time<br />writing software closer to hardware, high performing software.<br /><br />But let's not point fingers. I'm a great example of being part of the problem.<br /><br />So... I have a need of some custom made software. And I (following the steps of<br />my grandfather) build my own stuff when I need it. When I wanted a program that<br />would generate random workouts for me (from one of the great Pavel's programs),<br />I wrote it myself. When I wanted a helper program for my guitar studies, I wrote<br />another one. When I wanted a super simple monologuing service, I wrote my own.<br /><br />But I did it all as web apps. Which could be OK if the plant was to make it<br />public and share with the world. But it was always just for me. So instead of<br />writing a program that's small, fast, doesn't require a whole web stack and a<br />deployment process I've went with an "easy" solution: at the end of the day I do<br />spend most of my time doing fullstack web apps.<br /><br />And then I saw this talk. And then I saw more of John Blow's talks and listened<br />to Casey in some podcasts. And I got sad. And I've tried to write C and I was<br />scared of C. And that's when it got me.... Me? Afraid of C? I've made my first<br />money programming in C. I wrote my bachelor's work in C. I studied C in the<br />university. I was never scared of C. But now I was.... I felt vulnerable without<br />a garbage collector. I'm not even trying to be funny. It was what I felt.<br /><br />So... That was it. That was the point that kicked me in the face. Did I lose it?<br />Am I really a software developer? Have I regressed after my university years?<br /><br />I guess I'm trying to say: I'll be writing software for myself in C. And it will<br />be executables that I can run on my local machine without an internet<br />connection. (SDL2 will help for sure.) And I'm actually excited about that.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>26 Mar, 2021</h3><div>I've been recently doing some C coding with SDL2. Just following the handmade hero videos and trying to reimplement some of the basic ideas like:<br />- open a window<br />- put pixels on window<br />- put pixels in a back buffer and copy that buffer to the window's buffer<br /><br />That's where I am at right now. I don't have a deadline or a plan. I just enjoy the process of discovering how basic gamedev and computer graphics work without the help of a framework. I do use SDL2, cause I'm on Mac and it seems to be the best thing to use when you want a "lower" level access to graphics and such but don't want to build everything from scratch. I think at this point I enjoy learning about how games work more than playing them. To be honest I haven't played anything since one year ago when I had insomnia and one night tried to play the original Zelda and couldn't achieve any progress and gotten frustrated. I'm sure 12 yo me would've had more success but he's not around anymore. He's gone. Surfing the waves of the quantum information field of nowhere.<br /></div></div></div>        </code>    </body></html>
