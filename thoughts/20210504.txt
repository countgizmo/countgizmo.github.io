... on the other hand, the food tastes so good after 36 hours of none of it. And I'm choosing only the best, tastiest things in the fridge, cause if I have a limit (and we all do have a limit, we just forget that we do) I'm making sure I get the most goodness and pleasureness.

It's not all doom and gloom though. During those 36 hours I mean. At least if you have something intellectual to occupy yourself with: coding, reading, thinking, gaming, etc. My focus is way deeper and easier to achieve during the prolonged fasting period. And everything becomes much more interesting. Just make sure you're not reading a novel written by a decadent French chef called "The Last Food Orgasm" while you're fasting. Cyberpunk works great - there's not a single tasty thing that was ever present in a cyberpunk story. Math books are great! Programming is nice cause you just get into the code editor and start thinking about each letter of code with great intensity. Cause... what else are you going to do?

Anyway... it's easier to write about it now, on Tuesday, which is not Monday. I've already had my home-made sugar-free berry jello. And I'm gonna have a fat-coffee with vanilla whey protein. And then I'm gonna think of a nice dish with meat and veggies and tons of fat. It's raining outside and I can eat till it's like 6-7 PM. Seize the plate, Luke!
