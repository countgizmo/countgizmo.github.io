You wake up. Small and transparent. And weak. And everything and everyone are bigger and pushing you down and away and out. And you find your heroes. Someone who gives you power. Someone with big shoulders to stand on. You find them in movies, books, playgrounds, dreams, school, music. And then they help you grow and not end it too soon. You cry with them and laugh with them. And they don't know you exist but they fell you exist. And then you get older. And you get to see them die one by one by one by one. And only after they are all gone and your world is shattered and your heart is fucking broken. You get to die too.
