I did find my camera a couple of days ago and took it with me for a<br />wonderful cold and gray walk through a district of Berlin that is particularly<br />hipstery and vibrant (yes, the smell of weed is everywhere... and it's a good<br />smell).<br /><br />I will not bore you with the whole photo real but there's one photo that kind of<br />fits today (2021... need to remember... not to write 2020 for the next 12<br />months...).<br /><br /><img src="img/howto_leave_matrix.jpeg" /><br /><br />Also, I just needed an image to work on my monologue engine's image support.<br />(Yes, this glorious website is generated by software I wrote myself during this<br />winter holiday).<br /></div></div></div>        </code>    </body></html>
