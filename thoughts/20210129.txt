And we're back!
Now, in Norway. The snow outside is everywhere. The cold is persistent, strong and... surprisingly fun. I have been getting myself more and more familiar with the cold after I moved from Thailand to Germany and discovered I can finally have proper cold showers. After that I started sleeping under a thinner blanket during the winter time, otherwise I couldn't sleep because I was too hot and too sweaty. With the window open and the heating turned off.
So, obviously cold has become a sort of a friend. And now, rediscovering the Wim Hof method that I've used in Thailand everytime I felt flue-like symptoms, I'm getting in a more intense relationship with cold. Also now the cold is not this small tiny creature in the corner but a bigger beast ready to bite your head of if you show any signs of fear.
Fun times. Also the shower is much colder here during winter time. So I'm having all kinds of fun painful experiences while trying not to go into shock.
Other than that... the amounts of coffee I can drink without effect on my sleep is now unlimited. I do need to find a thinner blanket though. The current airbnb apartment has one of those super synthetic, light but fat and non-breathable blankets. I wake up sweaty even though the window is open and it's -16 C outside. Ruining my beauty sleep!
