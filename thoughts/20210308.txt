It's the 8th of March. And what am I doing? I'm tying in my text editor to see if it still works after I ran update on it. Seems to work. Seems to not throw weird error message in my console. It's 2021, god, I've been lied to all my life. No flying cars. I'm still dicking around with cables and adapters every day when I need to charge my phone. But the phone has so many cameras. 3 - I've just counted. And I have the cheaper model.

Busses still look like busses. Some of the are electric. Most of them are not.

I'll go to a meeting and then type some more.
