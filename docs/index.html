If we were in US I would've had a shotgun under my pillow. But... this is Norge! I mean Norway! We don't have guns under our pillows. We have a moose in the backyard, bacon cheese in a tube and quiet cold that works better than any freaking diet I have ever tried.<br /><br />Anyway, the escape route is set and if we live to see the morning light rising over the neighboring mountains we will get to a new flat, where the owner is human and sensible. Only then we can start doing what we should've done already -- setting up the documents, the great electronic persona of Scandinavia and also do some work!<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>29 Jan, 2021</h3><div>And we're back!<br /><br />Now, in Norway. The snow outside is everywhere. The cold is persistent, strong and... surprisingly fun. I have been getting myself more and more familiar with the cold after I moved from Thailand to Germany and discovered I can finally have proper cold showers. After that I started sleeping under a thinner blanket during the winter time, otherwise I couldn't sleep because I was too hot and too sweaty. With the window open and the heating turned off.<br /><br />So, obviously cold has become a sort of a friend. And now, rediscovering the Wim Hof method that I've used in Thailand everytime I felt flue-like symptoms, I'm getting in a more intense relationship with cold. Also now the cold is not this small tiny creature in the corner but a bigger beast ready to bite your head of if you show any signs of fear.<br /><br />Fun times. Also the shower is much colder here during winter time. So I'm having all kinds of fun painful experiences while trying not to go into shock.<br /><br />Other than that... the amounts of coffee I can drink without effect on my sleep is now unlimited. I do need to find a thinner blanket though. The current airbnb apartment has one of those super synthetic, light but fat and non-breathable blankets. I wake up sweaty even though the window is open and it's -16 C outside. Ruining my beauty sleep!<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>11 Jan, 2021</h3><div>I've stumbled upon a practical way of using average numbers in real life.<br /><br />Yeah, I know what an average is, but to be honest I have never seen a lot of<br />sense of using it in real life. Unless you are splitting the bill into equal<br />parts or something. But that happens less frequently these days.<br /><br />But, reading this book about information theory today, I've noticed a fun way to<br />use average numbers.<br /><br />Let's try some examples.<br /><br />Example one:<br /><br />I live in a country where average salary is 5$. I know that my salary is 7$.<br />This automatically means that there must be at least one person that has a<br />salary that is less than 5$. Probably around 3$. And the higher my salary is in<br />comparison to the known average (that is probably reported in the news every<br />year either to brag or to shock the readers even if the readers are the same<br />people that write the news) the lower the salary of someone else in the same<br />country.<br /><br />[It's probably obvious to some math-brained people, but it wasn't to me, so shut<br />up!]<br /><br />Example two:<br /><br />If an average life span of a human is 59 years (a number that I've just<br />invented) and you go to a cemetery and find a grave stone of a child that was<br />alive for only 5 days... there must be a person in the world who is waaaaay<br />older than 59 years (I'm too lazy to calculate but you get the idea).<br /><br />What do it all mean to me?<br /><br />I'm not trying to be philosophical about it (although I can). I'm just seeing<br />this cool way of getting a quick sure information about the world by knowing<br />just two numbers, when one of those numbers is an average and the other one is a<br />sample from that average. Makes me appreciate math (which I usually don't do<br />often). And makes me a bit scared when I think up more and more example based on<br />my personal data and the average numbers.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>06 Jan, 2021</h3><div>Sometimes when I'm walking outside (in 3d and full color) and passing near a bus<br />stop I see someone rushing towards the bus that has been standing there for a<br />few moments already with opened doors. People have already finished loading into<br />the bus. I can feel the doors beginning to close, the driver not seeing that<br />there's a person outside in the cold unfriendly street doing the best she can to<br />make it, running (maybe for the first time in years) with bags dangling in her<br />arms hitting her knees and messing up with her rhythm. And then... sometimes,<br />not every time, that rushing someone makes it to the bus. In these moments I<br />forget about most of the things. In these moments a wave of satisfaction and<br />warmness rushes over me. I feel good about the person that's made it onto the<br />bus in the last moment. I feel good about the driver. I feel good about the<br />other passengers. I feel good about people standing outside, seeing the same<br />small... miracle.<br /><br />It works with trams as well. It doesn't work with trains or subways.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>04 Jan, 2021</h3><div>Wow, fourth of January already. It was the New Year celebration just a second<br />ago. We were eating salads and a cake and drinking coffee and tea and proseco<br />and singing songs and talking bullshit. And then it was midnight in Berlin and I<br />was brushing my teeth while everyone else were trying to burn the town down<br />(again). And now it's the fourth of January already. And soon it will be the 21st.<br /><br />But meanwhile we are here (and we are there if we are reading this much later).<br /><br />So, the previous year was special in a lot of ways. One of them was me<br />discovering a new musical artist (and his band) during one random event of an<br />insomnia. Two things happened one summer night in 2020: 1. I couldn't sleep, so<br />I've opened YouTube and clicked on a random music video, which was a concert by<br />Billy Strings. 2. I've realized that insomnia can provide an unexpected gift, so<br />you should never think of insomnia as a bad thing.<br /><br />Yeah, I was listening to a lot of live Billy Strings shows afterwards,<br />discovering the bluegrass genre, playing more guitar myself and singing songs<br />about drugs, prison and... summertime.<br /><br />I didn't have insomnia as often last year as before. Even though I was secretly<br />looking forward to more surprises from YouTube's algorithm, sleep deprived brain<br />and open-mindedness. I guess all that diet, vitamin supplements (D3 and B-100 in<br />particular) and consistent meditation practice -- they all did something to me.<br />Tonight I have seen one of the weirdest dreams of my life and I wasn't even<br />super tired or high yesterday.<br /><br />Anyway, I guess the point of this post is: go listen to Billy Strings. And if<br />you cannot sleep for some reason, just get up and try to enjoy non-sleeping<br />(don't try to be productive, try to be happy). That's all the advice I have for<br />the future me today.<br /><br />Fourth of Jan already??? Really??? I'm gonna be old and dead soon.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>01 Jan, 2021</h3><div>I have completely forgot about my camera yesterday, so there will be no photos<br />of Benjamin eating legendary Olivier salad, also not photos of Katya singing and<br />me making a fool of myself with an electric guitar.<br /><br />But... I did find my camera a couple of days ago and took it with me for a<br />wonderful cold and gray walk through a district of Berlin that is particularly<br />hipstery and vibrant (yes, the smell of weed is everywhere... and it's a good<br />smell).<br /><br />I will not bore you with the whole photo real but there's one photo that kind of<br />fits today (2021... need to remember... not to write 2020 for the next 12<br />months...).<br /><br /><img src="img/howto_leave_matrix.jpeg" /><br /><br />Also, I just needed an image to work on my monologue engine's image support.<br />(Yes, this glorious website is generated by software I wrote myself during this<br />winter holiday).<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>31 Dec, 2020</h3><div>The last day of 2020. I cannot not write anything about it today while it's<br />happening. Well, for me it's just beginning to happen, but I have already seen<br />my NZ friends are chilling at a beach basking in the summer sun (those upside<br />down kiwi life is confusing).<br /><br />Anyway, out Christmas tree AKA new year's tree AKA yolka has been standing<br />beautifully for the last two weeks. Planted temporarily in a red bucket full or<br />reach fertilized by our worms soil. The tree has actually started to smell of<br />pine a couple of days ago. I think it's decided to grow roots in the bucket.<br /><br />The chocolate cake is ready and the infamous Russian salad with a french name<br />Olivier is in works. But that's not the main thing. (I know, how can a chocolate<br />homemade cake not be the main thing). The main thing is that another year of the<br />Rat is over, done, finished. So next year is a transitioning year for me (a Rat)<br />and my wife (also a Rat but a more cute one than I am). I will probably write<br />some thoughts down when it actually happens, but for now I'm just grabbing the<br />edge of my seat to make sure I don't lose the control (of which I have almost<br />none at this point).<br /><br />So, what did I do in the morning oh the last day of 2020? Read about Information<br />Theory. Sounds smart and it's probably is, but when I say I was reading about<br />it, I mean I was looking at this simple logarithm for 30 minutes to try and<br />understand it. (I have a file of notes on it though, and I don't think that's<br />the amount of notes a person needs to understand a logarithm formula, but... I'm<br />not that person).<br /><br />Anyway, just got a request from my wife: "Make some coffee!" So gotta run. Drink<br />coffee, eat food, meat the 2021 and dive into it to get all the gifts and<br />surprises.<br /><br />P.S. OK, I'm back (the coffee is cooking, ah the technology!). If you, future<br />me/my avid readers are wondering where are all the smart philosophical thoughts<br />about the corona virus and the US election and the global heating and the new M1<br />chip... These are all available everywhere else in the Internet. This is my<br />website. My thought for today is: Russian cottage cheese pancakes (сырники) are<br />a wonderful breakfast!<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>28 Dec, 2020</h3><div>My wife says it's too difficult for people think good happy thoughts. I tend to<br />agree. It's quite easy to prove this to myself as well. Just try to sit down and<br />simply think happy thoughts. Difficult, right? Sometimes even impossible. You<br />sit there for 5-10-20 minutes trying to come up with one good thought and you<br />cannot. It's especially difficult if I say: memories are not allowed. Plus,<br />memories are sooo different for different people. Some of us have full lives of<br />happy moments, others... better stay away from that memory pool.<br /><br />But I wonder. What if I make this a practice: 5 minutes a day make myself think<br />happy/good/positive thoughts. And leave the happy memories for extra occasions.<br />Meaning, I could try sitting there thinking about what's good happening in my<br />life right now, or in the world, or just daydreaming of something really nice.<br />And what if I do that every day. Will it make my brain more accustomed to think<br />good and not bad. Will it make me less critical of everything and more<br />understanding? Will I start to see more opportunities and less obstacles?<br /><br />Let's try and see what happens.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>27 Dec, 2020</h3><div>I was itching to write some code today. Like really. Felt an itch somewhere under my teeth. That sort of itch that you usually can't scratch. But this time I could.<br /><br />I finished watching the Norwegian cartoon of the day (used for practice Norsk comprehension and fun and family building exercise) and opened my emacs, which is spacemacs with customization and nonsense. And started to code on that small project I was doing a couple of days ago for myself.<br /><br />The project is called "Sparrow Says..." and its current purpose to generate kettlebell assignments for me based on Pavel's book "The Quick and the Dead". It involves a lot of dice rolling and coins flipping and my actual dice rolls kept giving me the same exercise (randomness is an illusion it seems). So the app is using a bunch of Clojure's random functions (only one actually, rand-int).<br /><br />I haven't actually coded much, but ended up messing with TailwindCSS a whole bunch, updating the deployment script (babashka) and looking at the wonderful results in the browser.<br /><br />Confession: the images I've used are not mine, but it will do as a placeholder. I should draw my own pixel art images for kettlebell snatches and swings.<br /><br />Current result can be seen <a href="https://ziggytwister.com/sparrow-says/">here</a><br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>25 Dec, 2020</h3><div>My friend Oli has a very-very-very nice personal <a href="https://www.eidel.io/">website</a><br />The highlights are the: the articles and the Reading.<br /><br />The articles are a good source of no-bullshit information about... anything really. And in the reading section he writes short summaries on the books he's read.<br /><br />For people who don't know him that well or at all, there are also links to his talks and other nonsense but I usually check only the main "thread" and the reading list. I was even mentioned in one of the reading list's entries (not as an author though!).<br /></div></div></div>        </code>    </body></html>
