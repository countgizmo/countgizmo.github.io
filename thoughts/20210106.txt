Sometimes when I'm walking outside (in 3d and full color) and passing near a bus
stop I see someone rushing towards the bus that has been standing there for a
few moments already with opened doors. People have already finished loading into
the bus. I can feel the doors beginning to close, the driver not seeing that
there's a person outside in the cold unfriendly street doing the best she can to
make it, running (maybe for the first time in years) with bags dangling in her
arms hitting her knees and messing up with her rhythm. And then... sometimes,
not every time, that rushing someone makes it to the bus. In these moments I
forget about most of the things. In these moments a wave of satisfaction and
warmness rushes over me. I feel good about the person that's made it onto the
bus in the last moment. I feel good about the driver. I feel good about the
other passengers. I feel good about people standing outside, seeing the same
small... miracle.

It works with trams as well. It doesn't work with trains or subways.
