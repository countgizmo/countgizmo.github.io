Why would anyone start a blog in 2020? Garry Vee said "TikTok!", not dry text on even drier screen. Sorry, Garry. I'm doing the text thing.

### But why?!

First reason: I was getting jealous of my friend Oli, who has a blog that doesn't get updated very often but when it does it's always with his personal opinions. Also his blog is quite clean (in terms of text with no images, not in terms of language). So I wanted one as well.

Second reason: I had a blog. A looong time ago. I used to publish daily (that was my habit, which I refused to quit for several years straight). It was about everything and nothing. It was in Russian and it was a glimpse into myself as a person, citizen, programmer, whatever-else-label-one-can-thing-of. And I used to enjoy posting every day. Then I stopped. Then I started using Russian less and less. So why not do it again, this time in English. And share it with Oli! That will show him!

Third reason: I've tried posting on every social platform where I have an account (ashamed to admit I have a few). And I don't think there's anything bad with it but I couldn't remember where I posted this or that. And since I don't have a particular topic or a theme it was randomness spread thinly across a small part of this place we call the Internet. I wanted everything in one place but still shareable.

### Why not use a blogging service then?

Several reasons to be honest:
1. I wanted something much simpler than Wordpress (as an example).
2. I didn't want any analytics - tracking visits count was one of the things that ruined my first blog.
3. I wanted something text based. In case I want to switch where and how I host my blog.
4. I wanted a static blog, so no database, no fancy dynamic page generation. Just HTML being sent to the readers.

### Fine, you have a blog. Now what?

I don't know. Let's try and post this...
