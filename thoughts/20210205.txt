Note to self: never rent an airbnb flat from a crazy person.

Sleeping with the bedroom door closed from the inside just in case. If we were in US I would've had a shotgun under my pillow. But... this is Norge! I mean Norway! We don't have guns under our pillows. We have a moose in the backyard, bacon cheese in a tube and quiet cold that works better than any freaking diet I have ever tried.

Anyway, the escape route is set and if we live to see the morning light rising over the neighboring mountains we will get to a new flat, where the owner is human and sensible. Only then we can start doing what we should've done already -- setting up the documents, the great electronic persona of Scandinavia and also do some work!
