Wow, fourth of January already. It was the New Year celebration just a second
ago. We were eating salads and a cake and drinking coffee and tea and proseco
and singing songs and talking bullshit. And then it was midnight in Berlin and I
was brushing my teeth while everyone else were trying to burn the town down
(again). And now it's the fourth of January already. And soon it will be the 21st.

But meanwhile we are here (and we are there if we are reading this much later).

So, the previous year was special in a lot of ways. One of them was me
discovering a new musical artist (and his band) during one random event of an
insomnia. Two things happened one summer night in 2020: 1. I couldn't sleep, so
I've opened YouTube and clicked on a random music video, which was a concert by
Billy Strings. 2. I've realized that insomnia can provide an unexpected gift, so
you should never think of insomnia as a bad thing.

Yeah, I was listening to a lot of live Billy Strings shows afterwards,
discovering the bluegrass genre, playing more guitar myself and singing songs
about drugs, prison and... summertime.

I didn't have insomnia as often last year as before. Even though I was secretly
looking forward to more surprises from YouTube's algorithm, sleep deprived brain
and open-mindedness. I guess all that diet, vitamin supplements (D3 and B-100 in
particular) and consistent meditation practice -- they all did something to me.
Tonight I have seen one of the weirdest dreams of my life and I wasn't even
super tired or high yesterday.

Anyway, I guess the point of this post is: go listen to Billy Strings. And if
you cannot sleep for some reason, just get up and try to enjoy non-sleeping
(don't try to be productive, try to be happy). That's all the advice I have for
the future me today.

Fourth of Jan already??? Really??? I'm gonna be old and dead soon.
