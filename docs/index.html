A really good one. Like, a person clearly spent a lot of time preparing the material, synthesising the interesting bits, figuring out a way on how to simplify it and present as a 10 minute (or 20 minute if presenter is someone born in USA), making the video, editing it, etc. And then I scroll to the comment section and there will be a comment like "You are an idiot and your mom is fat!" Or something even more terrible, like "You are totally wrong, lol!", which is like the whole reason the Internet exists, right? Telling people they are wrong...<br /><br />Or there will be comments for someone's insta photos or someone's drawing, someone's song or even someone's indie game. And the comments will just be violent, stupid and 100% negative (funnily enough, most of the start with "I don't want to sound like a jerk, buuut...").<br /><br />And I think I know the reason. Like, the mechanical reason. No psycho-emotional-artsy-fartsy-bull-shit. Mechanically, it's takes a lot of effort to make something, like a video, and it takes even more effort to publish it, especially if it includes the author herself or even just the voice (we all know how we feel when we hear our own voice recorded secretly and suddenly played back to us). And it's waaaay easy to just click inside the comment box and start typing and then hit "send" or "Save" or whatever. Most of the times you don't even need to register or login to leave a comment. So if you wanna be mean, it's really easy to be mean. Even being accidentally mean is so easy it's sometimes unavoidable (I did it several times, cause I didn't take good care of what I was trying to say and just typed and submit and then hurt someone's feelings for no reason except my stupidity).<br /><br />The answer might be: balance things out. Make commenting as difficult. One way that I can see is: if you want to comment on some video on youtube you must have published public videos, at least ten of those, real ones (just for example). The same goes for other platforms where people publish their art, work or artwork. Then you know what it's like to show your work to everyone, you know what goes into making that work and you probably are more experienced and ready to comment on some work from the same media. Also the receiving author will know that you're not just a random dood from cyberspace, bored and horrible, but you might actually know what you're talking about cause otherwise you wouldn't have the feature to comment.<br /><br />As a software developer I find it's also easy to implement, so I don't see why not have a system of ... basically rank. Nobody gets to post nothing. An author can engage in conversation with other authors. And even then it might depend on the ranking system. Like: you posted 10 videos... you can like/dislike other videos, you posted 10 more, you can leave emojis, you posted a 100, now you get to write comments with like words and sentences and exclamation points.<br /><br />And I know, some people fuel their ego or just get motivated by reading comments like "you're great!", but I think (and I'm just a horrible nobody) that this is not a good motivation. The motivation should come from you digging the process and having some vision or just experimenting cause you enjoy it or just getting to practice a craft. The motivation should never come from your drinking buddies cheering you on. A lot of great work/art was done behind closed doors, in bedrooms offline, inside minds and empty hallways, on a bus while commuting to work for the millionth time. Without any comments.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>29 Apr, 2021</h3><div>I want to talk about Apple. Cause why not. Everyone's doing it. There are whole sub-genres of podcasts dedicated to talking about Apple. Seriously, how valuable is that?<br /><br />So I wanna jump in and complain and criticise something I haven't even tried to do: create and sell expensive products to trillions and trillions of people in all countries, rich or poor.<br /><br />The last online keynote presentation thing made me think new thoughts. While ten keynotes before that cause absolutely zero thoughts in my brain. So might as well write them down.<br /><br />I see an issue. And it's probably my personal issue but here it goes... Image, I don't have a computer and I want one. Just one. Cause I've heard that it's 2021 and you only need one and I don't have that much money. So I want a computer. Kind of like when people wanted a VCR they didn't want 5 VCRs, they wanted one. It was so straightforward that you didn't have to mention it to anyone: you either had one and you wanted a new one or you had zero and you wanted A one.<br /><br />So I want a computer and I've heard nice things about Apple. And I vaguely remember the rebel spirit of underdog Apple of the late nineteen-ninety-X. And I go to their website, cause the stores are all in lockdown and I forgot how to use walk-in stores and how to talk to people... like ... without Zoom??? How's it even possible?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm on their website-online-shop-thing and I want a computer. And....<br /><br />-- Hey, Apple!<br />-- Whatup dood?<br />-- Sell me a computer. A good one.<br />-- OK, which one do you want?<br />-- I don't know. I want a good one I guess. I've just told you that, right?<br />-- Don't need to be so touchy. I got ya! Do you want a big screen or a small one?<br />-- I don't know. I wanted a computer, I didn't think about screens. I guess a big one is better, right?<br />-- For sure! You should get an iMac.<br />-- Great! Is it heavy? Cause you know, I move around a lot. Every 2 years I pack my stuff and relocate to another planet.<br />-- Digital Nomad ay?<br />-- Don't call me that! I hate that term. They always show lazy hipsters in Thailand pretending they're coding in their swimsuit. Have you tried coding on a beach... in Thailand?<br />-- Nah man, I don't travel much. I'm from California, USA! The best country in the nation!<br />-- Right. So... iMac... heavy?<br />-- Not exactly. But.... you can't just take it with you. I mean, you can, but you need a desk and an electrical outlet to plug it in.<br />-- Doesn't sound right. It's 2021, don't you have a portable computer?<br />-- Do I! I have MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. And like... the biggest one is 16 inches! It has a battery and you can try coding from a beach in Thailand... until it overheats and powers down in 2 seconds. That's what you wanted, right?<br />-- Yeah! Is it heavy though?<br />-- Depends on whom you ask. You know, I workout. Like, lots! So for me it's not heavy at all. Check this out, see these biceps? All natty!<br />-- Ok-ok. I've heard you can like ... touch screens for some reason. Can I touch those screens on MacBooks?<br />-- Hell no! This is like... super uncool. Only Microsoft does that. And who wants Microsoft's anything, right? You feel me?<br />-- Ok... Do you have a portable computer that's not heavy (I don't workout lots) and that I can touch screens with?<br />-- I have an iPad.... Pro! I also have an iPad Air. And just iPad.<br />-- Ok, what's wrong with those?<br />-- They are kind of not computers. You get your software from my app store. And you want something else... you need to code it yourself I guess. In machine code... while blindfolded. And you need a special keyboard-case thing for typing this long-ass blog posts you like. It's not included by the way.<br />-- Ok, what's the difference between all the iPads...?<br />...<br /><br />And so it goes forever and ever. Until one of you gives up. And it's probably you. And you either buy something... randomly. Or you close the website-online-shop thing from Apple and open another one. Which is much easier to do than to go around the city from one location to another.<br /><br />This is my problem. The product line is so huge, complex and highly overlapping. And at the same time every product missing some valuable bit that's present in another product but that other product is almost missing some bit... For no good reason except for money-generating-capitalism-is-so-nice-yo reason.<br /><br />I hope I won't need a new computer that I would have to chose and buy myself anytime soon.<br /><br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>26 Apr, 2021</h3><div>I wanted to post it here for a long time now. I guess that's why I haven't. I've<br />been falling down the rabbit whole into the world of Casey Muratori and Jonathan<br />Blow (and everything related).<br /><br />Now, I've already written about my Handmade Hero discovery and my SDL2 coding<br />attempts, which are still bringing me joy and frustration, but mostly joy. It's<br />all kind of related but even I cannot remember at this point what happened<br />first.<br /><br />Just watch this: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZSRHeXYDLko" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />It's a great talk, isn't it? It's also sad because it's true. I have been<br />thinking about this topic for awhile now, especially lately when I've noticed<br />that we spend more time and effort talking about whitespace and comments<br />formatting than we do about performance. To be honest we do get to performance,<br />but... It's not the first thing on our agenda (and maybe it shouldn't be). But I<br />have noticed that fewer and fewer programmers that I personally know spend time<br />writing software closer to hardware, high performing software.<br /><br />But let's not point fingers. I'm a great example of being part of the problem.<br /><br />So... I have a need of some custom made software. And I (following the steps of<br />my grandfather) build my own stuff when I need it. When I wanted a program that<br />would generate random workouts for me (from one of the great Pavel's programs),<br />I wrote it myself. When I wanted a helper program for my guitar studies, I wrote<br />another one. When I wanted a super simple monologuing service, I wrote my own.<br /><br />But I did it all as web apps. Which could be OK if the plant was to make it<br />public and share with the world. But it was always just for me. So instead of<br />writing a program that's small, fast, doesn't require a whole web stack and a<br />deployment process I've went with an "easy" solution: at the end of the day I do<br />spend most of my time doing fullstack web apps.<br /><br />And then I saw this talk. And then I saw more of John Blow's talks and listened<br />to Casey in some podcasts. And I got sad. And I've tried to write C and I was<br />scared of C. And that's when it got me.... Me? Afraid of C? I've made my first<br />money programming in C. I wrote my bachelor's work in C. I studied C in the<br />university. I was never scared of C. But now I was.... I felt vulnerable without<br />a garbage collector. I'm not even trying to be funny. It was what I felt.<br /><br />So... That was it. That was the point that kicked me in the face. Did I lose it?<br />Am I really a software developer? Have I regressed after my university years?<br /><br />I guess I'm trying to say: I'll be writing software for myself in C. And it will<br />be executables that I can run on my local machine without an internet<br />connection. (SDL2 will help for sure.) And I'm actually excited about that.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>26 Mar, 2021</h3><div>I've been recently doing some C coding with SDL2. Just following the handmade hero videos and trying to reimplement some of the basic ideas like:<br />- open a window<br />- put pixels on window<br />- put pixels in a back buffer and copy that buffer to the window's buffer<br /><br />That's where I am at right now. I don't have a deadline or a plan. I just enjoy the process of discovering how basic gamedev and computer graphics work without the help of a framework. I do use SDL2, cause I'm on Mac and it seems to be the best thing to use when you want a "lower" level access to graphics and such but don't want to build everything from scratch. I think at this point I enjoy learning about how games work more than playing them. To be honest I haven't played anything since one year ago when I had insomnia and one night tried to play the original Zelda and couldn't achieve any progress and gotten frustrated. I'm sure 12 yo me would've had more success but he's not around anymore. He's gone. Surfing the waves of the quantum information field of nowhere.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>25 Mar, 2021</h3><div>Billy Strings got a Grammy for him "Home" albumn.<br /><br />This is a good things.<br /><br />Warm days have started to pile-up in Norway. It's already hard to find snow in Oslo, but in my neighbourhood... it still looks like deep winter in other countries I know.<br /><br />I have discovered a world of tiled window managers... for MacOS. Helps a lot when you have a million windows to manage and only<br />one big monitor. The monitor has enough space for everything... but how does one figure out the windows placement... Tiled window managers, man... That's the truth.<br /><br />I just wanted to test my auto site building one more time really. Nothing to see here :)<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>23 Mar, 2021</h3><div>I'm basically testing the githubactions CI thing I've created.<br />This should help me build the site easier: I commit a new thought (as a wondeful text file) and then magic happens and I have one less thing to do.<br />Next step is to make it easier to generate new empty thoughts on my local computer, but that's something for the future me.<br /><br />In other news: the weather is wonderful, the coffee is consumed outside in the garden chair, the snow is melting... I guess you can call it fast for Norway.<br />I've been thinking: since a lot of people got into playing chess after watching (binging) the Queen's Gambit show... maybe it will level up the humanity's capabilities for deep concentration, improve the cognitive skills and so on. And smarter future humanity will realise all their mistakes, fix them and finally create flying cars powered by thoughts. Maybe?<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>09 Mar, 2021</h3><div>"One of the most valuable unicorns in the world" - actual phrase I would never expect to read in a serious media. But that's the world we live in. We have valuable unicorns. And there's obviously a competition amongst them.<br /><br />In other news... AIs writing news articles after 2 seconds of the actual event happening. Journalists? Who are they?<br /><br />I was thinking about text yesterday. People came up with the idea of writing stuff down and then reading that stuff consistently. Then other people figured out that you can write human-readable text and make computers translate it to computer-readable text and then run it and suddenly have virtual and physical consequences (usually in real time) based on what's been written. And now people are making computers read human text by using special text written by humans and fed into machines so that machines could write human text like the human texts they read before by using special human-readable-computer-translated text. Do you see? It's an endless loop of textual information that's now converging on itself. The snake is eating itself. And the snake is text. The thing that was invented one billion trillion years ago. One of the simples ways that people could figure out to transmit data through time and space, through brain to brain, and now it's becoming this self-sustaining thing and it's all just text (it's all data - scream Clojure people but I can't hear them).<br /><br />Weird-weird world.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>08 Mar, 2021</h3><div>It's the 8th of March. And what am I doing? I'm tying in my text editor to see if it still works after I ran update on it. Seems to work. Seems to not throw weird error message in my console. It's 2021, god, I've been lied to all my life. No flying cars. I'm still dicking around with cables and adapters every day when I need to charge my phone. But the phone has so many cameras. 3 - I've just counted. And I have the cheaper model.<br /><br />Busses still look like busses. Some of the are electric. Most of them are not.<br /><br />I'll go to a meeting and then type some more.<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>28 Feb, 2021</h3><div>I did a thought experiment yesterday that had more effect than anything Tony Robbins might say.<br /><br />It's about embarrassment. You know, that feeling, when you do something stupid in public or even in front of a single person. And then you go home and you keep feeling that feeling more and more until it becomes this embarrassment about embarrassment and you feel your face getting hot and your heart pounding. Basically you're trying to give yourself a heart attack because you did something stupid (and maybe not even intentionally stupid, like falling on your face accidentally because it was slippery).<br /><br />That feeling has been bugging me all my life. And from what I know, other people often have it. The feeling is the worst because it also inhibits your future behavior and actions. Like, you think, well, I could try talking to this person but that one time I remember I said "hi" to this guy and he's made a face and everyone stared at us... like, everyone and then he has just turned away and I was standing there like an idiot. I better not try this again. Just don't talk to people. Ever.<br /><br />And if you're like me (and since I'm writing this down for myself -- you are me!) you've also heard many times how you are the only person who remembers that kind of stuff from your past. The guy that didn't say "hello" back, the people that saw that happening -- all of them don't remember, and don't even try to remember that situation. And I always thought, yeah, that makes sense probably, but... I was still embarrassed about being embarrassed that time or another. I kept imagining people sitting in their kitchens on Saturday mornings remembering and even discussing out loud how I messed up that time, how I fell down, how I tried to make a joke and no one laughed, how I had my pants' zipper unzipped all day in front of everyone, how I was too loud and everyone hear me saying personal things about my dreams...<br /><br />So yesterday... Yeah, literally at age 36.5 I've decided to try this hat on: I've tried to remember something embarrassing that someone else did. Anyone, friend, foe or stranger. Ever. I've tried really hard. And, you've guessed it, I couldn't remember a single situation. And my memory is quite good (even now). It's so good it's often uncomfortable the amount of useless facts I remember. But I couldn't recall how anyone did something embarrassing. And while I was trying to do that I sort of understood why.... At least one of the many whys. I couldn't remember it because I haven't felt embarrassed about anything I didn't do. No, really. Think about it. Like, people say it in the movies a lot: "Oh, you've made us so embarrassed..." But even then they were embarrassed. It's like there's no empathy for embarrassment. We can feel each other's joy or sadness or, of course, pain. But... we cannot feel each other's embarrassment that well or at all. Or even if we do it's so... transient that we don't remember any of it. And we were probably embarrassed ourselves in the beginning anyway.<br /><br />Now, I could remember one situation. About my friend peeing in my bed at night that one time he stayed over because his parents were away. We were like 10 or 11 years old. And the only reason I can remember it is that every time I meet him now, which happens every several years, he keeps retelling me that story. I don't know why, but telling that story makes him really happy. So I guess it's not even an embarrassing story. And when I recalled it I didn't really feel embarrassed about him or me. It was just this story from my childhood. Not the worst story either.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're reading this, you're not me and you have this problem with keep remembering your own embarrassing moments, try the experiment -- switch roles and see for yourself. No one remembers this stuff outside themselves. Now you are free, go an embarrass the fuck out of you!<br /></div></div><div class="post"><h3>23 Feb, 2021</h3><div>The great youtube random video generator (AKA artificial intelligence algorithm that costs one trillion megabucks) put this into my headphones. Yeah, I wasn't even looking at the video, it was just playing music to me starting with Moby... and then this happened:<br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1wgaFJ0750" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />I like it. It's haunting. Makes you feel like something from not of this world will knock on your door in a few seconds. And make you choose: stay safe and die old with a whole on your under pants, or go and die young in suffering and become a verse in an old creepy song.<br /></div></div></div>        </code>    </body></html>
