I have completely forgot about my camera yesterday, so there will be no photos
of Benjamin eating legendary Olivier salad, also not photos of Katya singing and
me making a fool of myself with an electric guitar.

But... I did find my camera a couple of days ago and took it with me for a
wonderful cold and gray walk through a district of Berlin that is particularly
hipstery and vibrant (yes, the smell of weed is everywhere... and it's a good
smell).

I will not bore you with the whole photo real but there's one photo that kind of
fits today (2021... need to remember... not to write 2020 for the next 12
months...).

Also, I just needed an image to work on my monologue engine's image support.
(Yes, this glorious website is generated by software I wrote myself during this
winter holiday).
