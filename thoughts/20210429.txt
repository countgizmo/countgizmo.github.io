I want to talk about Apple. Cause why not. Everyone's doing it. There are whole sub-genres of podcasts dedicated to talking about Apple. Seriously, how valuable is that?

So I wanna jump in and complain and criticise something I haven't even tried to do: create and sell expensive products to trillions and trillions of people in all countries, rich or poor.

The last online keynote presentation thing made me think new thoughts. While ten keynotes before that cause absolutely zero thoughts in my brain. So might as well write them down.

I see an issue. And it's probably my personal issue but here it goes... Image, I don't have a computer and I want one. Just one. Cause I've heard that it's 2021 and you only need one and I don't have that much money. So I want a computer. Kind of like when people wanted a VCR they didn't want 5 VCRs, they wanted one. It was so straightforward that you didn't have to mention it to anyone: you either had one and you wanted a new one or you had zero and you wanted A one.

So I want a computer and I've heard nice things about Apple. And I vaguely remember the rebel spirit of underdog Apple of the late nineteen-ninety-X. And I go to their website, cause the stores are all in lockdown and I forgot how to use walk-in stores and how to talk to people... like ... without Zoom??? How's it even possible?

Anyway, I'm on their website-online-shop-thing and I want a computer. And....

-- Hey, Apple!
-- Whatup dood?
-- Sell me a computer. A good one.
-- OK, which one do you want?
-- I don't know. I want a good one I guess. I've just told you that, right?
-- Don't need to be so touchy. I got ya! Do you want a big screen or a small one?
-- I don't know. I wanted a computer, I didn't think about screens. I guess a big one is better, right?
-- For sure! You should get an iMac.
-- Great! Is it heavy? Cause you know, I move around a lot. Every 2 years I pack my stuff and relocate to another planet.
-- Digital Nomad ay?
-- Don't call me that! I hate that term. They always show lazy hipsters in Thailand pretending they're coding in their swimsuit. Have you tried coding on a beach... in Thailand?
-- Nah man, I don't travel much. I'm from California, USA! The best country in the nation!
-- Right. So... iMac... heavy?
-- Not exactly. But.... you can't just take it with you. I mean, you can, but you need a desk and an electrical outlet to plug it in.
-- Doesn't sound right. It's 2021, don't you have a portable computer?
-- Do I! I have MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. And like... the biggest one is 16 inches! It has a battery and you can try coding from a beach in Thailand... until it overheats and powers down in 2 seconds. That's what you wanted, right?
-- Yeah! Is it heavy though?
-- Depends on whom you ask. You know, I workout. Like, lots! So for me it's not heavy at all. Check this out, see these biceps? All natty!
-- Ok-ok. I've heard you can like ... touch screens for some reason. Can I touch those screens on MacBooks?
-- Hell no! This is like... super uncool. Only Microsoft does that. And who wants Microsoft's anything, right? You feel me?
-- Ok... Do you have a portable computer that's not heavy (I don't workout lots) and that I can touch screens with?
-- I have an iPad.... Pro! I also have an iPad Air. And just iPad.
-- Ok, what's wrong with those?
-- They are kind of not computers. You get your software from my app store. And you want something else... you need to code it yourself I guess. In machine code... while blindfolded. And you need a special keyboard-case thing for typing this long-ass blog posts you like. It's not included by the way.
-- Ok, what's the difference between all the iPads...?
...

And so it goes forever and ever. Until one of you gives up. And it's probably you. And you either buy something... randomly. Or you close the website-online-shop thing from Apple and open another one. Which is much easier to do than to go around the city from one location to another.

This is my problem. The product line is so huge, complex and highly overlapping. And at the same time every product missing some valuable bit that's present in another product but that other product is almost missing some bit... For no good reason except for money-generating-capitalism-is-so-nice-yo reason.

I hope I won't need a new computer that I would have to chose and buy myself anytime soon.
